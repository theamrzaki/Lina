 SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE," Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.", L3713, L3712,m3
 CONTINUED," I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.", L3721, L3720,m3
 CONTINUED, She's wonderful., L3729, L3728,m3
 CONTINUED," Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.", L3750, L3749,m3
 CONTINUED, How did they manage to do that without any communication?, L3757, L3756,m3
 CONTINUED," I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.", L3771, L3770,m3
 CONTINUED, We're trying to get there. I hope we can., L3778, L3777,m3
" Hi. Frank... coming in, please.", Right. Just a sec., L3943, L3942,m3
 Okay. ," Okay, come on down.", L3945, L3944,m3
" Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something."," Sure, what is it?", L3964, L3963,m3
" Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.", What's up?, L3966, L3965,m3
 It's about my salary cheques., Yes?, L3968, L3967,m3
" That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18."," Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.", L3973, L3972,m3
 Really., Yes., L3975, L3974,m3
" Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.", It's possible., L3980, L3979,m3
" Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?", I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out., L3982, L3981,m3
" I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training."," No. I never did, either.", L3984, L3983,m3
 I suppose the idea was specialized training.," I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.", L3988, L3987,m3
 Oh?, Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out., L3990, L3989,m3
" No, as a matter of fact, I didn't."," Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.", L3992, L3991,m3
 I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told., That seems very unlikely., L3996, L3995,m3
" Yes, I thought so."," Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.", L3998, L3997,m3
 How?," Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.", L4000, L3999,m3
" Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training."," Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.", L4012, L4011,m3
 I know. It would be almost inconceivable., But not completely inconceivable?, L4014, L4013,m3
 I suppose it isn't logically impossible., I guess it isn't., L4016, L4015,m3
" Well, that's something."," Yes, I don't know what to make of it.", L4160, L4159,m3
 I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.," Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.", L4162, L4161,m3
 Good morning. How's it going?, Are you reasonably awake?, L4189, L4188,m3
" Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?", Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again., L4191, L4190,m3
 You're kidding., No., L4193, L4192,m3
 I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure., Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?, L4197, L4196,m3
 Two more.," Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.", L4199, L4198,m3
 Hal?, Yes., L4209, L4208,m3
 It's the last one.," Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.", L4283, L4282,m3
 I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.," I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.", L4297, L4296,m3
 I guess not., I think I'll have to go out and burn them off., L4299, L4298,m3
" I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.", He's got a point., L4007, L4006,m3
" Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem."," What is it, Hal?", L4069, L4068,m3
" The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours."," I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.", L4080, L4079,m3
" Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something."," Sure, Dave, what's up?", L4220, L4219,m3
 You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?," Yes, I know.", L4222, L4221,m3
 You probably also know that we found them okay.," Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.", L4224, L4223,m3
" I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong."," Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?", L4228, L4227,m3
" Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear."," Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.", L4230, L4229,m3
" Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history."," I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.", L4266, L4265,m3
" Well, don't worry about it.", And don't you worry about it., L4268, L4267,m3
 Is your confidence in me fully restored?," Yes, it is, Hal.", L4270, L4269,m3
" Too bad about Frank, isn't it?"," Yes, it is.", L4334, L4333,m3
" I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.", The antenna has to be replaced., L4347, L4346,m3
 Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.," It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.", L4349, L4348,m3
" If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble."," I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.", L4354, L4353,m3
" Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me."," Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.", L4356, L4355,m3
" I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest."," Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.", L4361, L4360,m3
" I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it."," Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.", L4363, L4362,m3
 I am prepared to do that anyway.," I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.", L4367, L4366,m3
 CONTINUED," Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.", L3971, L3970,m3
 CONTINUED, Did they have any explanation for this?, L3978, L3977,m3
 CONTINUED," Well, what is it?", L3994, L3993,m3
 CONINUED," Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?", L4003, L4002,m3
 CONTINUED," Still, you really don't believe it, do you?", L4010, L4009,m3
 CONTINUED," Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?", L4019, L4018,m3
" I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?"," I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?", L3669, L3668,m3
 I'm having a party tomorrow.," Yes, I know that sweetheart.", L3673, L3672,m3
 Are you coming to my party?," No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.", L3675, L3674,m3
 When are you coming home?," In three days, darling, I hope.", L3677, L3676,m3
" One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?", Mommy's out to the hair- dresser., L3680, L3679,m3
 Where is Mrs. Brown?, She's in the bathroom., L3682, L3681,m3
" Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.", How many days until you come home?, L3684, L3683,m3
" Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow."," Thank you, Daddy.", L3689, L3688,m3
" I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?"," Yes, Daddy.", L3691, L3690,m3
" 'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart."," Goodbye, Daddy.", L3693, L3692,m3
" Oh, thank you very much.", Thank you., L3798, L3797,m3
" Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.", I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later., L3806, L3805,m3
 Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.," Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.", L3808, L3807,m3
" I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.", I'll bet it's a fortune., L3810, L3809,m3
 And your charming little daughter?," Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.", L3731, L3730,m3
" Oh, that's such a delightful age.", How is gregor?, L3733, L3732,m3
 He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.," Well, where are all of you off to?", L3735, L3734,m3
 Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.," Well, that does sound very odd.", L3759, L3758,m3
 Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?," No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.", L3775, L3774,m3
" Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.", Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov., L3780, L3779,m3
" How do you do, Mr. Miller?"," I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.", L3623, L3622,m3
" Well, thank you very much for being so understanding."," Please, it really doesn't matter.", L3627, L3626,m3
 Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?," Yes, very pleasant.", L3629, L3628,m3
" Well, shall we go through Documentation?", Fine., L3631, L3630,m3
" Yes, I think so. Just about then.", I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking., L3652, L3651,m3
" Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.", Are you quite sure?, L3725, L3724,m3
" Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon"," Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?", L3739, L3738,m3
" I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean."," Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.", L3746, L3745,m3
 Really?," Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.", L3748, L3747,m3
" Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.", You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?, L3752, L3751,m3
 That's right., I see., L3754, L3753,m3
" Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention."," Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.", L3761, L3760,m3
" Fortunately, they did."," Well, I'm glad about that.", L3763, L3762,m3
" Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?", Certainly., L3767, L3766,m3
" This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.", Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this., L3773, L3772,m3
" Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?", I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement., L3869, L3868,m3
" Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.", How can you tell it was deliberately buried?, L3890, L3889,m3
 By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill., Any clue as to what it is?, L3892, L3891,m3
 But you don't have any idea as to what it is?," Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.", L3897, L3896,m3
 Any ideas about the colour?," Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?", L3905, L3904,m3
 Has it been exposed to any sun before now?," I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?", L3907, L3906,m3
" Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.", There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest., L3818, L3817,m3
 When do we arrive at Clavius?, We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?, L3820, L3819,m3
 Thank you.," Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?", L3825, L3824,m3
 What do you mean?, Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty., L3827, L3826,m3
 I see., I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?, L3829, L3828,m3
" Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her."," I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.", L3833, L3832,m3
" Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?"," No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.", L3838, L3837,m3
" Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false."," I will if I can, Frank.", L4021, L4020,m3
 Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?, True., L4023, L4022,m3
 Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?, That's true., L4025, L4024,m3
 That's true.," Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?", L4029, L4028,m3
 That's true," There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?", L4031, L4030,m3
 That's true.," Thank you very much, Hal.", L4033, L4032,m3
" Hal, have pod arms secure the component.", Roger., L4097, L4096,m3
" Five by five, Frank."," Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.", L4109, L4108,m3
 I understand.," Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.", L4111, L4110,m3
 Roger.," Hal, check all airlock doors secure.", L4113, L4112,m3
 Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors., Opening pod bay doors., L4119, L4118,m3
" Yes, Hal, what's up?", It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure., L4170, L4169,m3
" I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.", Let me see the tracking alignment display., L4175, L4174,m3
 Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?," Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.", L4182, L4181,m3
 Appipulai Leeloo Minai.., Corn-i-Lius?, L5644, L5643,m5
 What're you laughing about?, Napoleon... small., L5674, L5673,m5
 The case..with the stones... Where is it?, San Agamat chay bet... envolet!, L5679, L5678,m5
 Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!, You know exactly where they are!, L5693, L5692,m5
" Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!"," No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.", L5876, L5875,m5
 Akta dedero ansila do mektet., I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape., L5890, L5889,m5
 ...We're saved!, I'm fucked!, L5711, L5710,m5
 Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again, I remember you now..the so called art dealer., L5738, L5737,m5
" I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?", ...Why on earth do the stones interest you?, L5740, L5739,m5
" Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...", Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you., L5742, L5741,m5
 Why?  What's wrong with me?," ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.", L5744, L5743,m5
 ...would you like a drink?, No thank you., L5747, L5746,m5
" ...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!", They are robots!, L5752, L5751,m5
" Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!", Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another., L5755, L5754,m5
" You are a monster, Zorg!", I know..., L5761, L5760,m5
" Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.", Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations., L5614, L5613,m5
" She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.", That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?, L5616, L5615,m5
 Who are you?, I brought the girl remember?, L5621, L5620,m5
 He's a she!, You noticed..., L5625, L5624,m5
" There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!", So you do know her., L5627, L5626,m5
" They all like this in your family, father?", She's an exception.., L5649, L5648,m5
 Thank you so much for your help Mr...?, Dallas. Korben Dallas., L5651, L5650,m5
 Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!," I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?", L5653, L5652,m5
" She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.", I know. I was there when she arrived., L5655, L5654,m5
 Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?," It means, ""Never without my permission"".", L5657, L5656,m5
" I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.", Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?, L5827, L5826,m5
 We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission.., What kind of mission?, L5829, L5828,m5
 We have to save the world., Good luck.., L5831, L5830,m5
 Of course.," Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.", L5833, L5832,m5
 What are you doing?, Trying to save your ass so you can save the world., L5840, L5839,m5
 You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.," Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.", L6169, L6168,m5
 Leeloo's in trouble?, When is she not in trouble?, L6171, L6170,m5
 Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?," Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!", L6259, L6258,m5
 There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.," Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.", L6264, L6263,m5
" And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?", That's what I'm saying., L6266, L6265,m5
" Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.", One more reason to shoot first eh?, L5464, L5463,m5
 Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!," Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.", L5469, L5468,m5
" We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.", And then?, L5509, L5508,m5
 Is there anything that can stop it?, Yes..thank God.., L5512, L5511,m5
 But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?, White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity., L5516, L5515,m5
 Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.," Thank you, Mr. President.", L5522, L5521,m5
 What are we going to do?," This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.", L5557, L5556,m5
 It's a miracle!!!, What is?, L5631, L5630,m5
" Father, will you please explain what's going on?"," The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!", L5637, L5636,m5
 Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?, Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!, L5647, L5646,m5
 What's she doing?," Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.", L5672, L5671,m5
" Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..", Yes. Of course.., L5676, L5675,m5
 There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names..., I didn't know your size., L5687, L5686,m5
 They really made her..., Perfect., L5689, L5688,m5
 I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!," Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.", L5731, L5730,m5
 Where's Leeloo?, On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one., L5912, L5911,m5
 You're all safe. Thanks be to God!," Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!", L6252, L6251,m5

 Mine's J.F. Sebastian., Hi., L87741, L87740,m34
 You want to go home?, I don't have one., L87744, L87743,m34
 Where are your folks?, They left., L87747, L87746,m34
 What about friends?," I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.", L87749, L87748,m34
 We scared each other pretty good didn't we?, We sure did., L87752, L87751,m34
" I'm hungry, J.F.", I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?, L87754, L87753,m34
 Whatcha doin'?, You scared me., L87769, L87768,m34
 You look... better., Just better., L87772, L87771,m34
 Beautiful., Thanks., L87774, L87773,m34
 And you live in this building all by yourself?," Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...", L87776, L87775,m34
 Twenty., What's your problem?, L87780, L87779,m34
 Methuselah Syndrome., What's that?, L87782, L87781,m34
 My glands.  They grow old too fast., Is that why you're still here?, L87784, L87783,m34
" Ah, you get hold of your friends?"," As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.", L87788, L87787,m34
 Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much., I keep a lot of provisions right here., L88123, L88122,m34
 What makes you think so?, You're all so perfect., L88205, L88204,m34
 Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!," I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --", L117630, L117629,m41
" I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.", What is it?, L117634, L117633,m41
 Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?," Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...", L117638, L117637,m41
 What?," When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.", L117640, L117639,m41
 And you say he doesn't remember any of it?, Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?, L117652, L117651,m41
 Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...," Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.", L117664, L117663,m41
 Anything., A journal. Just have him write down everything he does., L117666, L117665,m41
 Why? What for?, It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days., L117668, L117667,m41
" Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...", And the bad news?, L117697, L117696,m41
" Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.", But you must have something to go on?, L117699, L117698,m41
" If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.", But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?, L117701, L117700,m41
 Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.," Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.", L117703, L117702,m41
 You'd be surprised how often they are.," Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.", L117705, L117704,m41
" It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.", How soon?..., L117707, L117706,m41
" Evan wake up, oh please wake up!"," Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!", L117772, L117771,m41
" Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.", So what did you find., L118162, L118161,m41
" No dances, just tell me.", The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions., L118342, L118341,m41
 We're gonna be late again., When did you ever care about getting to school on time?, L117611, L117610,m41
" Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy."," Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.", L117614, L117613,m41
 Darn it!, Um... can dad come this time?, L117616, L117615,m41
 You know the answer to that., Can't he come out for one day?, L117618, L117617,m41
 We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him., But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad..., L117620, L117619,m41
 All the dads are gonna be there.," I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?", L117623, L117622,m41
 No., Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there., L117625, L117624,m41
" I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!", You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him., L117656, L117655,m41
" That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss."," My father has a bad memory, too?", L117660, L117659,m41
" These'll bring you luck, Crockett.", Great. I'll see you soon., L117671, L117670,m41
 What happened?, Honey. What were you doing with that?, L117675, L117674,m41
" Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?", Okay., L117711, L117710,m41
 I don't know... I don't remember., Something must've happened! What set him off?, L117748, L117747,m41
 I... I blacked out., Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!, L117750, L117749,m41
" Please, mom. People will talk.", I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes., L117916, L117915,m41
 Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?, Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him., L117918, L117917,m41
 Why do you ask?," No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.", L117921, L117920,m41
" I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...", Sure..., L117924, L117923,m41
" And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...", What? What could he do?, L117926, L117925,m41
" ...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.", How long will I be in here?, L118099, L118098,m41
 I don't know. These things take time., How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?, L118101, L118100,m41
 I found these. The others are still in storage.," Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!", L118104, L118103,m41
" Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?"," Cute, Evan.", L118158, L118157,m41
 What does that mean for Evan?," He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?", L118167, L118166,m41
 There must be a way to fix this., Fix?, L118291, L118290,m41
 You're. Acting. Like your father.," Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.", L118298, L118297,m41
 How. Did you. Know that?," You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.", L118300, L118299,m41
 Just. Like. Jason., Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here., L118302, L118301,m41
 Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way., Can you protect me?, L118096, L118095,m41
" You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about ""the Lord works in mysterious ways?""", Straight up., L118114, L118113,m41
 Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me., Shit. I knew you were crazy., L118116, L118115,m41
" So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely."," You need to see the prison shrink, man.", L118120, L118119,m41
 Just tell me if anything weird happens., Weirder than this?, L118124, L118123,m41
 What did you see? What did it look like?, Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!, L118132, L118131,m41
" Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.", You know my father?, L117658, L117657,m41
 Dad lives here?," Not in this wing, actually. No.", L117709, L117708,m41
" Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?", Yes., L117754, L117753,m41
 Where are you now?," I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.", L117756, L117755,m41
 Are you hurting her?," No, protecting her.", L117758, L117757,m41
 Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?, I see a car., L117760, L117759,m41
" Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.", I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods., L117763, L117762,m41
" The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.", It's coming... argh! I can't!, L117765, L117764,m41
 It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before., Are you sure? Not even with my father?, L118160, L118159,m41
 This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex., Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?, L118164, L118163,m41
" Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.", Where are my goddamn books?, L118332, L118331,m41
 Books?, My journals! Where are they?, L118334, L118333,m41
" Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...", But I... I need those books., L118337, L118336,m41
 You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one., Photos?, L118339, L118338,m41
" Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.", I thought you were a December baby., L117841, L117840,m41
" It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.", Like Ozzy., L117851, L117850,m41
" Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.", That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart., L117855, L117854,m41
 You really think he wanted to kill you?, All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories., L117897, L117896,m41
 I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --, What the fuck are you doing?, L117929, L117928,m41
 Are you stupid or what?, What?, L117932, L117931,m41
 Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?, Huh?, L118022, L118021,m41
 Get out. Both of you.," Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.", L118241, L118240,m41
" We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.", So let's go. This place creeps me out., L117722, L117721,m41
 Oh God... what did we do?," Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!", L117743, L117742,m41
 I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea., You really don't remember anything that happened?, L117787, L117786,m41
 Ouch., I'm sorry., L117791, L117790,m41
 It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny., Damn. Your dad did this?, L117793, L117792,m41
 I deserve a lot worse., What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit., L117795, L117794,m41
" I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?", He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore., L117806, L117805,m41
 Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?," He must be. They're letting him go, right?", L117809, L117808,m41
 Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.," Hi, Lenny.", L117815, L117814,m41
" God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?"," Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...", L117937, L117936,m41
" No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.", I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good..., L117939, L117938,m41
 Not since we were kids., I've stopped a hundred times., L117941, L117940,m41
 So how's Tommy?, They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody., L117943, L117942,m41
 No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen., Wow. That must've taken some courage., L117946, L117945,m41
 Not if you remember my dad., Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?, L117948, L117947,m41
" Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.", Me? Are you kidding? Why?, L117951, L117950,m41
 Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?, Of course., L117953, L117952,m41
" Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help."," Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.", L117955, L117954,m41
 When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?," What do you want to know, Evan?", L117957, L117956,m41
 It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?, It was a long time ago., L117959, L117958,m41
" I know, but...", Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?, L117961, L117960,m41
" Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.", You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak., L117968, L117967,m41
" Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.", Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed., L118004, L118003,m41
 Where... where are my clothes?," Those are your clothes, silly.", L118006, L118005,m41
" Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?"," Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?", L118014, L118013,m41
" Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?", So it didn't feel... weird?, L118038, L118037,m41
" What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?", As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?, L118043, L118042,m41
" I don't understand, where are you taking me?", You'll see., L118051, L118050,m41
 I don't know what to say. It's beautiful., Go on. Sit down., L118053, L118052,m41
 Why are you doing all this for me?, Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you., L118055, L118054,m41
 It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago., Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun., L118064, L118063,m41
" Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me."," Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.", L118066, L118065,m41
" It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids."," Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.", L118068, L118067,m41
 Are you okay?, What do you mean?, L118072, L118071,m41
" It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?", Like how?, L118074, L118073,m41
 I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same., I walk differently?, L118076, L118075,m41
" I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...", I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us., L118078, L118077,m41
 Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?, What?, L118080, L118079,m41
" Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!", He's a fucking maniac!, L118091, L118090,m41
" I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --", Evan. Stop it. It's not the time., L118146, L118145,m41
" Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone."," Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?", L118197, L118196,m41
" So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.", I get it. You can drop it now., L118204, L118203,m41
" Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?", No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been., L118206, L118205,m41
 Ha! Where's that?, The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack., L118208, L118207,m41
 What's happened to you?," You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, ""You wouldn't believe me"", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.", L118210, L118209,m41
" I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.", Why's that?, L118212, L118211,m41
 Because you're... different., Different? How?, L118214, L118213,m41
 Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years., Yeah?, L118216, L118215,m41
 On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch., Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?, L118218, L118217,m41
" You're right, Evan, I don't believe you."," I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.", L118220, L118219,m41
 I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?," I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.", L118222, L118221,m41
 Oh? There's proof now?, Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?, L118224, L118223,m41
 Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.," Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.", L118226, L118225,m41
 I just thought you should know., Know what?, L118229, L118228,m41
 There's one major hole in your story., Which is?, L118232, L118231,m41
 Sure you don't want your wallet?, Don't think I'll need it where I'm going., L118235, L118234,m41
" Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.", I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit., L118237, L118236,m41
 Where are we going?, We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages., L118252, L118251,m41
 You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.," He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.", L118266, L118265,m41
 Is something the matter?," Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.", L118268, L118267,m41
" Kayleigh? Do you ever think about ""us?"" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?"," Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.", L118270, L118269,m41
 I was?, That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother., L118272, L118271,m41
 I don't get it.," When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.", L118274, L118273,m41
 I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?, It's crossed my mind from time to time., L118276, L118275,m41
 And...?," Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.", L118278, L118277,m41
 Then you think it might have worked out?," Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.", L118280, L118279,m41
 We're really gonna be in a movie!?," That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.", L117687, L117686,m41
 Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?," Calm down, kid. Stand still.", L117691, L117690,m41
 I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?, Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been., L117693, L117692,m41
 What time is it?, It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you., L117988, L117987,m41
 What's happened to -- How are you doing that?," It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.", L117991, L117990,m41

" What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?", You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal., L168655, L168654,m50

 Did you tell them that I flooded the school?, I didn't say shit., L168952, L168951,m50
 That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.," Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.", L168954, L168953,m50
 Dea ex machina..., What did you say?, L169287, L169286,m50
 How can you do that?, I can do anything I want... and so can you..., L168836, L168835,m50
 Why did you make me flood the school?, We just want to guide you in the right direction., L168851, L168850,m50
 Who is... we?, You'll know soon enough., L168853, L168852,m50
 Where did you come from?," Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?", L168855, L168854,m50
 I want to show you something., You have to do something for me first., L169080, L169079,m50
 You have a request?, Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit., L169082, L169081,m50
 Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?, Take it off. I want to see you., L169084, L169083,m50
 What happened to your eye?, I am so sorry., L169087, L169086,m50
 Why do they call you Frank?, It is the name of my father... and his father before me., L169089, L169088,m50
 How much longer is this gonna last?," You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.", L169091, L169090,m50
" DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!", We went to a hotel., L168650, L168649,m50
 My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?, I don't wanna talk about it., L168652, L168651,m50
 How old is Grandma Death?," A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.", L168829, L168828,m50
" What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!", Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine., L169307, L169306,m50
 Hey..., Hey..., L168748, L168747,m50
 Wanna walk me home?, Sure., L168751, L168750,m50
 Don't look so freaked., I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit., L168753, L168752,m50
 So... you just moved here?, Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems., L168756, L168755,m50
" Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?", He stabbed my mom four times in the chest., L168758, L168757,m50
 Wow. Did he go to jail?, He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool., L168760, L168759,m50
" I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.", Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero., L168762, L168761,m50
 I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind., That's easy. Antiseptics., L168765, L168764,m50
" I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.", You mean soap?, L168767, L168766,m50
" Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.", Wonder where we'll be then., L168769, L168768,m50
 The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect., Until it withers away., L168771, L168770,m50
 It's a good thing the school was flooded today., Why is that?, L168773, L168772,m50
 You're weird., I'm sorry., L168776, L168775,m50
 That was a compliment., Will you go with me?, L168778, L168777,m50
 Where are we going?," No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.", L168780, L168779,m50
 Where are you going?, I'm going home., L168783, L168782,m50
" So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?"," No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.", L168864, L168863,m50
 It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.," So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?", L168867, L168866,m50
 No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge., And you'd never been there before?, L168869, L168868,m50
 Donnie?, Yeah?, L168871, L168870,m50
 Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?, Why?, L168873, L168872,m50
 What happened to your neck?, I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?, L168958, L168957,m50
" Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.", Why not just buy your baby a night light?, L168962, L168961,m50
 That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.," With, like, images?", L168964, L168963,m50
 You know... we've been going together for a week and a half..., And what?, L168967, L168966,m50
 Well..., You want to kiss me..., L168969, L168968,m50
 That's alright... I understand.," No... Donnie, wait. I've never...", L168971, L168970,m50
 I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be., Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us., L168973, L168972,m50
 We're moving through time., What?, L169016, L169015,m50
 They suspended me for two days., Are you okay?, L169037, L169036,m50
 I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?, Who?, L169039, L169038,m50
" Oh, yeah.  ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"". What is this?", She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?, L169042, L169041,m50
 I know she's here. She never leaves the house., Maybe she's asleep., L169044, L169043,m50
" So, we call them... IMGs.", Infant Memory Generators., L169065, L169064,m50
" Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.", And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside., L169067, L169066,m50
 What? How long was I asleep?, The whole movie. Let's go., L169099, L169098,m50
 You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?, What's wrong with you?, L169141, L169140,m50
 Will you please talk to me?," Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.", L169169, L169168,m50
 Hey., Hey. You OK?, L169252, L169251,m50
 My mom is gone., Where is she?, L169254, L169253,m50
 I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up., But you're OK?, L169256, L169255,m50
 Did you call the cops?," Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.", L169258, L169257,m50
 I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it., It's safe here., L169260, L169259,m50
 What?," There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.", L169265, L169264,m50
 Come with me., Where are we going?, L169270, L169269,m50
 Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her., Why? Is this about the book?, L169273, L169272,m50
 No. Frank., Who's Frank?, L169275, L169274,m50
 Is that a cellar door?, Yeah..., L169280, L169279,m50
" I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.", Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline., L168888, L168887,m50
 I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple., The Lifeline is divided that way., L168890, L168889,m50
" Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.", Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions., L168892, L168891,m50
 People aren't that simple.," If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.", L168895, L168894,m50
 Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.," No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.", L168571, L168570,m50
 You're such a fuck-ass., When did you stop taking your medication?, L168583, L168582,m50
" Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?", We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table., L168588, L168587,m50
 I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?," I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.", L168597, L168596,m50
 You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today., Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?, L168599, L168598,m50
 Grandma Death., That is a terrible nickname., L168922, L168921,m50
" He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?"," Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.", L169063, L169062,m50
 I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow., Do you get to meet Ed?, L169156, L169155,m50
" If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.", How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?, L169158, L169157,m50
 So how was school today?," It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.", L168676, L168675,m50
 Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match., Do they know yet?, L168678, L168677,m50
 Know what?, Where it came from?, L168680, L168679,m50
 No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it., So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?, L168682, L168681,m50
" Oh, shit!", Grandma Death., L168685, L168684,m50
 Grandma Death.," You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.", L168924, L168923,m50
" You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.", I guess she just lost faith in the world., L168927, L168926,m50
 Who's been giving you weird looks?, A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it., L169102, L169101,m50
 You're my only son...," I know, Dad.", L169104, L169103,m50
" Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?", Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things., L168668, L168667,m50
 Who is Frank?, A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit., L168877, L168876,m50
" And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.", Why should we care?, L169132, L169131,m50
" Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.", Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?, L169134, L169133,m50
 Is the death of one species less tragic than another?, Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die., L169136, L169135,m50
 Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?," Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?", L169172, L169171,m50
 Where are you going?, I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me., L169174, L169173,m50
 That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.," Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.", L169176, L169175,m50
 What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?, Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue., L169178, L169177,m50
" What's ""Cellar Door""?"," A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that ""Cellar Door"" is the most beautiful.", L169180, L169179,m50
 Cellar door., Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going., L169182, L169181,m50
 So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?, I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me., L169184, L169183,m50
 Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.," I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.", L168689, L168688,m50
" So, I met a new friend.", Would you like to talk about this friend?, L168692, L168691,m50
 His name is Frank., Frank., L168694, L168693,m50
 I think he saved my life., How so?, L168696, L168695,m50
 Don't you watch the news?, I don't own a television., L168698, L168697,m50
 Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened., He said to follow him., L168702, L168701,m50
 Follow him where?, Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end., L168704, L168703,m50
 Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?, No.  That's stupid., L168706, L168705,m50
" And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?", Yes., L168785, L168784,m50
" So, tell me about your day, Donald.", I met a girl., L168787, L168786,m50
 What is her name?, Gretchen. We're going together now., L168789, L168788,m50
 Do you think a lot about girls?, Yes., L168791, L168790,m50
 How are things going at school?, I think about girls a lot., L168793, L168792,m50
 I asked you about school., I think about... fucking a lot during school., L168795, L168794,m50
 What else do you think about during school?," I think... about... ""Who's the Boss?""", L168797, L168796,m50
 Who is the boss?, I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano., L168799, L168798,m50
" What about your family, Donnie?"," No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!", L168801, L168800,m50
 How many times have you seen Frank?, Four times... so far., L168929, L168928,m50
 Can anyone else see him?, I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's., L168931, L168930,m50
 Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?, I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous., L168933, L168932,m50
 A sign from whom?," I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.", L168935, L168934,m50
 How does that make you feel?, It reminded me of my dog Callie., L168937, L168936,m50
 Is Callie still around?, No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch..., L168939, L168938,m50
" I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?", No. That makes you keep searching., L168942, L168941,m50
 And they grow out of our stomachs?, It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something..., L169047, L169046,m50
 Nothing., Have you told Gretchen about the spears?, L169050, L169049,m50
" Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...", Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?, L169052, L169051,m50
" Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.", I know., L169056, L169055,m50
" I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.", The good stuff., L169058, L169057,m50
 Yeah... you know...  Fucking.," Have you ever made love, Donald?", L169060, L169059,m50
" And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?", Yes., L169189, L169188,m50
" So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?", I... I was playing with fire., L169191, L169190,m50
 People get hurt., But it was an accident. The house was under construction., L169194, L169193,m50
 People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone., But you were punished., L169196, L169195,m50
 Yes. I went to jail., Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?, L169198, L169197,m50
 They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year., What did you want for Christmas that year?, L169200, L169199,m50
 Hungry Hungry Hippos., How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?, L169202, L169201,m50
 Regret., What else makes you feel regret?, L169204, L169203,m50
 That I did it again., You've done it again?, L169206, L169205,m50
 Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.," Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?", L169208, L169207,m50
 I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means..., If God exists?, L169210, L169209,m50
 I think now that he might..., Why?, L169212, L169211,m50
 Because I'm so horny., God exists because you're horny., L169214, L169213,m50
 I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going., Where are we going?, L169216, L169215,m50
" Where are we going, Donald?", I have the power to build a time machine., L169218, L169217,m50
 How is that possible?, Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon., L169220, L169219,m50
 Then how is time travel possible?, It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore., L169222, L169221,m50
 When will this happen?, Soon. Time is almost up., L169224, L169223,m50
 What is going to happen?, Frank is going to kill., L169227, L169226,m50
 I can see him right now!," Where is he, Donald?", L169231, L169230,m50
 He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.," If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.", L169233, L169232,m50
 It's too late. I've already ruined my life.," You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.", L169235, L169234,m50
 Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water., Thank you., L169238, L169237,m50

It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?", Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --, L194268, L194267,m55
 Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?, Yeah., L194270, L194269,m55
" You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?", No., L194272, L194271,m55
" I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?"," No, not at all.", L194274, L194273,m55
" Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph."," Oh, yeah.", L194277, L194276,m55
" That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.", That's scary sounding., L194279, L194278,m55
" Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?", I think so., L194281, L194280,m55
" I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.", Okay., L194283, L194282,m55
 I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --, Sounds good. But right now I should go., L194286, L194285,m55
 You should stay.," I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...", L194288, L194287,m55
 I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that., Yes., L194291, L194290,m55
" So, I enjoyed meeting you."," You'll call me, right?", L194294, L194293,m55
 Yeah., When?, L194296, L194295,m55
 Tomorrow?, Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all., L194298, L194297,m55
 How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?, You didn't say anything about my hair., L194331, L194330,m55
 Yo ho ho!, It's three., L194423, L194422,m55
 I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic., ...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic., L194427, L194426,m55
" I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.", Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something., L194430, L194429,m55
" A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?"," No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?", L194434, L194433,m55
 Let me drive you home.," Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.", L194437, L194436,m55
 How can you watch this crap?, Where are you going?, L194456, L194455,m55
 Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?, I want to have a baby., L194459, L194458,m55
 Let's talk about it later., No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby., L194461, L194460,m55
 I don't think we're ready., You're not ready., L194463, L194462,m55
 What?!, I don't want to talk about this here., L194466, L194465,m55
 You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!," Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --", L194469, L194468,m55
" Oh, thank God. It's going."," It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!", L194472, L194471,m55
" So, um --"," Would you get me another, Joely?", L194477, L194476,m55
 You're drunk.," You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --", L194483, L194482,m55
" You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me."," No, it isn't that.", L194517, L194516,m55
 I want to know you., I just don't have anything very interesting about my life., L194519, L194518,m55
 More?, No. Thanks., L194525, L194524,m55
 Joely...," Yeah, Tangerine?", L194536, L194535,m55
 Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?, No., L194538, L194537,m55
 Such a beautiful view.," Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!", L194576, L194575,m55
 Oh?," I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.", L194578, L194577,m55
" Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?", I don't know., L194580, L194579,m55
 What if you hide me?, What do you mean?, L194585, L194584,m55
" I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.", I'm right here., L194591, L194590,m55
 I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...," Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.", L194593, L194592,m55
" You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over."," I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.", L194626, L194625,m55
 You remember what happened next?," I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --", L194628, L194627,m55
 There's this guy!, What?, L194631, L194630,m55
" There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.", Really? Is he cute?, L194633, L194632,m55
 He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!," Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.", L194635, L194634,m55
" But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.", Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally., L194660, L194659,m55
 They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now., Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?, L194663, L194662,m55
" Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?"," This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.", L194668, L194667,m55
 Joel!," I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --", L194682, L194681,m55
 Happy Birthday.," Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!", L194685, L194684,m55
 I scoured the city for it., I love it!, L194688, L194687,m55
" I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.", Yeah., L194744, L194743,m55
 I want to enjoy my little time left with you.," This is our first ""date"" date.", L194746, L194745,m55
 Do you remember what we talked about?," Naomi, I guess.", L194748, L194747,m55
 Yeah., What was I wearing?, L194750, L194749,m55
" God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper."," Egad, were you horrified?", L194752, L194751,m55
 Right. Something black though., I'll buy that. Black's always good., L194756, L194755,m55
 We did talk about Naomi., I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure., L194758, L194757,m55
" I'm sure, I said.", But you weren't. I could tell., L194760, L194759,m55
 I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:," So what. Infatuation is good, too.", L194763, L194762,m55
 I dropped you off after. You said --, Come up and see me... now., L194766, L194765,m55
 It's very late.," Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.", L194768, L194767,m55
 I told her today I need to end it., Is that what you want?, L194787, L194786,m55
" I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.", Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you., L194805, L194804,m55
 Yeah?, I'd like to... take you out or something., L194807, L194806,m55
" Well, you're married.", Not yet. Not married., L194809, L194808,m55
" Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.", Okay., L194811, L194810,m55
" Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.", I remember that speech really well., L194815, L194814,m55
" I had you pegged, didn't I?", You had the whole human race pegged., L194817, L194816,m55
 Probably., I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that., L194819, L194818,m55
 I know.," It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.", L194821, L194820,m55
 Hi there., Hi., L194863, L194862,m55
 You said...," I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.", L194866, L194865,m55
 Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.," I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.", L194868, L194867,m55
 You know what I did.," Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.", L194875, L194874,m55
 I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?, And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers., L194878, L194877,m55
" Oh God, how horrid.", I'm Joel., L194882, L194881,m55
" You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?"," Yeah, like that.", L194886, L194885,m55
" This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.", I know., L194889, L194888,m55
 What do we do?, Enjoy it. Say good-bye., L194891, L194890,m55
" No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.", I know what you mean. That's why I stopped., L194895, L194894,m55
 But my sleeping is really fucked up., I don't think I've slept in a year., L194897, L194896,m55
" You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.", yeah?, L194899, L194898,m55
 I'll give you a couple. See what you think., Okay., L194901, L194900,m55
 Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?, I love her., L194903, L194902,m55
" Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.", I think she's great., L194905, L194904,m55
 Me too. There's this poem --, Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?, L194907, L194906,m55
" I think, before.", Seems too coincidental that way., L194909, L194908,m55
" Do you know her poem that starts ""Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live..."," Yeah, yeah. It goes ""Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines""?", L194912, L194911,m55
 I wish we did. You married?," Um, no.", L194915, L194914,m55
 I do sort of live with somebody though., Oh., L194918, L194917,m55
 Male or female?, Female., L194920, L194919,m55
 Cool., What are you doing?, L194923, L194922,m55
" C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.", I hesitated for what seemed like forever., L194928, L194927,m55
 I knew., I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass., L194932, L194931,m55
 It's dark., Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?, L194934, L194933,m55
" Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.", I think we should go., L194937, L194936,m55
 So go.," I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, ""so go"" with such disdain.", L194942, L194941,m55
 What if you stay this time?, I walked out the door. There's no more memory., L194944, L194943,m55
" Bye, Joel.", I love you., L194947, L194946,m55
" So you'll call me, right?", Yeah., L194996, L194995,m55
 When?, Tomorrow?, L194998, L194997,m55
 Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines., Yeah., L195000, L194999,m55
 Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year., I don't know., L195026, L195025,m55
 I don't know. What if it breaks?, What if?, L195030, L195029,m55
 I think I should go back.," Joel, come here. Please.", L195032, L195031,m55
" Listen, did you want to make love?", Make love?, L195034, L195033,m55
 Have sex. Y'know --," Oh, um...", L195036, L195035,m55
 Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now., That's okay. I --, L195038, L195037,m55
 I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --," Hey, Joel --", L195040, L195039,m55
 -- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.," I'm nervous, too.", L195042, L195041,m55
 Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.," Well, you obviously don't know me.", L195044, L195043,m55
" Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.", Says you were a bully..., L195061, L195060,m55
 A bully? Moi?," That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.", L195063, L195062,m55
" Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious."," Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.", L195065, L195064,m55
" Did I use the term ""sexual conquests"" or is that your way of putting it.", I don't know., L195067, L195066,m55
 Doesn't sound like me.," Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.", L195069, L195068,m55
" Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?", I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic., L195071, L195070,m55
" You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my ""gratuitous need to shock.""", I can't stop thinking about you., L195098, L195097,m55
 Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill., What old mill? Is that somewhere we --, L195100, L195099,m55
 What took you so long?, I just walked in., L195019, L195018,m55
 Hmmm. Do you miss me?," Oddly enough, I do.", L195021, L195020,m55
" Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.", I guess so., L195023, L195022,m55
 Yeah?, Did you send this? Is it a joke?, L195048, L195047,m55
 I probably got the same thing as you.," I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?", L195050, L195049,m55
 Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape., That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke., L195052, L195051,m55
 It's true., I know. I spoke to my friend Magda., L195056, L195055,m55
" Look, I have to go. I have to think."," Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?", L195058, L195057,m55

" I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you."," God, I can't believe I ever hated you.", L195091, L195090,m55
 You must have been crazy., Guess what I'm wearing., L195093, L195092,m55
 I don't know. Panties and --, Your dried cum., L195095, L195094,m55
" Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.", Hi., L195002, L195001,m55
 How's it going?, Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick., L195004, L195003,m55
 I know. I had to take the day to think.," Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?", L195006, L195005,m55
 I just got in., Long day thinking., L195008, L195007,m55
 That's me.," There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...", L195012, L195011,m55
 It was snowing., There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette., L194302, L194301,m55
" The driver waved. So casual, friendly.", I'm like a joke to them., L194304, L194303,m55
 I might be making a mistake.," Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.", L194307, L194306,m55
 Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.," The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.", L194310, L194309,m55
 It's them., It's too late., L194315, L194314,m55
 I should maybe talk to you., Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her., L194318, L194317,m55
" I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and..."," Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...", L194320, L194319,m55
 Clementine., That's your look for me., L194322, L194321,m55
 Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!," Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!", L194337, L194336,m55
 So then she just stops calling., I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was., L194381, L194380,m55
" Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...", And what are you like? A wino?, L194432, L194431,m55
 How's the chicken?, Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?, L194522, L194521,m55
 She's so sexy., I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging., L194583, L194582,m55
 I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later., I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl., L194691, L194690,m55
 Naomi.," On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun", L194779, L194778,m55
 Okay. I wish you could come.," This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.", L194841, L194840,m55
" Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt."," I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.", L194860, L194859,m55
 So you're still on the Zoloft?, Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf., L194893, L194892,m55

 Kill you? Hardly that., Then why am I here? What did you want with me?, L222608, L222607,m63

 Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border., Does he ever mention me?, L238826, L238825,m74

 He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.

 Or we could do that., Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now., L239152, L239151,m74

" Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon.

 What do you mean?, I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear., L545771, L545770,m191
 Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.," But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?", L545773, L545772,m191
 No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt., Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling., L545775, L545774,m191
" According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-"," Wait.

 Well?, I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response., L545587, L545586,m191

 Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners., Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs., L536751, L536750,m195

 There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them., We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation..., L536818, L536817,m195

 He is very observant., I can see that., L540414, L540413,m198
 Data!," Sorry, sir.", L540423, L540422,m198
" Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.", Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed., L540503, L540502,m198
" Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.", On my way., L540707, L540706,m198
" My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.", Good work. The download?, L540783, L540782,m198
" A bit less florid, Data."," Aye, sir... This way.", L540787, L540786,m198
 A weapon., It would appear so., L540790, L540789,m198
 Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise., It'll only work for one of us., L540792, L540791,m198
" Yes, sir.", We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?, L540794, L540793,m198
" Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.", They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and..., L540800, L540799,m198
 What do you imagine this is?," Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?", L540804, L540803,m198
 Can you open the shuttlebay doors?," Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.", L540806, L540805,m198
 Do you think this is a wise course of action?, We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark., L540809, L540808,m198
" Ready, Captain.", Fire!, L540811, L540810,m198
 How long until we reach the fleet?, At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes., L540888, L540887,m198
" ""For now we see but through a glass darkly..."" He said he's a mirror.", Of you?, L540890, L540889,m198
 Yes.," I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.", L540892, L540891,m198
 But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.," He would deny a ""human"" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.", L540894, L540893,m198
" He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin"," No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.", L540896, L540895,m198
 How can you be sure?," I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.", L540898, L540897,m198
 We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it., It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?, L540901, L540900,m198
" Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications."," Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!", L540903, L540902,m198
 We are losing dorsal shields., Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!, L540915, L540914,m198
" Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.", Divert power and compensate., L541006, L541005,m198
 We are being hailed.," Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.", L541022, L541021,m198
" Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.", Negative., L541054, L541053,m198
 Why am I looking at me?, You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me., L540400, L540399,m198
 You have a red shirt., This is not an appropriate time for a conversation., L540418, L540417,m198
 Why?, Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle., L540420, L540419,m198
" Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.", How many of you did Dr. Soong make?, L540359, L540358,m198
 Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.," Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .", L540375, L540374,m198
" Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. IÆd say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data ."," Do you have a name, sir?", L540430, L540429,m198
 At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state., I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download., L540505, L540504,m198
" Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.", He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?, L540507, L540506,m198
" I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual."," An individual more like you, you mean.", L540509, L540508,m198
 Yes., Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is., L540511, L540510,m198
 What purpose does this serve?, It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?, L540524, L540523,m198
 Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions., It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?, L540526, L540525,m198
 But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.," Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.", L540529, L540528,m198
" We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.", Emergency force fields are holding., L540989, L540988,m198
 What is our approximate distance?, , L541062, L541061,m198
 It appears to be...  ... an arm., Why is it moving?, L540387, L540386,m198
 It's you., The resemblance is... striking., L540398, L540397,m198
 No., I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?, L540403, L540402,m198
 If you wouldn't mind., Thank you., L540411, L540410,m198
" Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast."," The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... IÆm a talking head.", L540279, L540278,m198
 And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know., The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed., L540281, L540280,m198
 May I have this dance?," With pleasure, Captain.", L540289, L540288,m198
 Counselor.," Do you have a moment, sir?", L540463, L540462,m198
" It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a ""family"" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.", You're speaking of emotional investment?, L540466, L540465,m198
" The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations."," As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.", L540468, L540467,m198
 I'm going to miss you., And I you., L540471, L540470,m198
" I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.", Is he sincere about wanting peace?, L540607, L540606,m198
" Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.", How could I not?, L540610, L540609,m198
" Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him."," I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!", L540612, L540611,m198
 Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties., Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I..., L540732, L540731,m198
 How can you be certain?, I know how he thinks., L540864, L540863,m198
 Captain -- I might have a way to find them., Counselor?, L540992, L540991,m198
 The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me., Make it so., L540994, L540993,m198
 But how can he? He'll kill you., This isn't about me anymore., L541049, L541048,m198
 I'm only half human.," Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.", L540570, L540569,m198
 Imzadi. This is so good., No!, L540619, L540618,m198
 He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you., This isn't real., L540621, L540620,m198
 I'll always be with you now. Now and forever., You sick bastard!, L540625, L540624,m198
 You're not here.," Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.", L540712, L540711,m198
 No.," I can feel your desire, Deanna.", L540714, L540713,m198
" Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?"," Your timing is impeccable, Commander.", L540963, L540962,m198
 The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.," When this is over, I owe you a drink.", L540965, L540964,m198
" I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.", Do you have life support?, L540985, L540984,m198
 , Understood., L540987, L540986,m198
 Open a channel., This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies., L541077, L541076,m198
 It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system., What do we know about the planet?, L540355, L540354,m198
 Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan., Theories?, L540357, L540356,m198
" I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.", What do we know about the population?, L540373, L540372,m198
 Cannon fodder., Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it., L540497, L540496,m198
 It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship., What programs were accessed?, L540685, L540684,m198
 That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts," Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.", L540687, L540686,m198
 I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.," Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.", L540691, L540690,m198
 It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet., And that's exactly what he's going to do., L540858, L540857,m198
 He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent., What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?, L541012, L541011,m198
 What's he doing?, He wants to look me in the eye., L541016, L541015,m198
 He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do., Sir?, L541018, L541017,m198
" Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me."," Aye, sir.", L541029, L541028,m198
" Deanna, on my mark."," Ready, sir!", L541031, L541030,m198

 Admiral Janeway. Good to see you., , L540476, L540475,m198
 With or without the rest of the fleet?," A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.", L540478, L540477,m198
 New Praetor?, There's more... as always. He's Reman., L540480, L540479,m198
"  Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.", Understood., L540482, L540481,m198
 , Not with the Romulans., L540484, L540483,m198

" So, human... you've met your better self!", What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?, L540772, L540771,m198
 I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours., That will never happen., L540774, L540773,m198
 It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest., There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species., L540777, L540776,m198
 I won't do it.," WonÆt do what, Mister Worf?", L540348, L540347,m198

 I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system., What sort of signature?, L540352, L540351,m198
" To find the head, sir?", If you don't mind., L540394, L540393,m198

" Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.", Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data., L540473, L540472,m198
 We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators., A coup d'etat?, L540499, L540498,m198
 Why don't they answer our hails?," It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.", L540534, L540533,m198
 It's working., Counselor?, L540536, L540535,m198
" Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.", Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait., L540541, L540540,m198

" He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.", Can anything be done for him?, L540834, L540833,m198

 Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled., And the Romulans invade., L540862, L540861,m198

" Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.", I would be interested to know what we are talking about., L540577, L540576,m198

" Right now, youÆre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?", Yes., L540583, L540582,m198

" We need to talk, just you and I.", Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us., L540596, L540595,m198

 Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it., You'll acquire a taste for it., L540641, L540640,m198

 You don't trust me., I have no reason to., L540653, L540652,m198
 Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youÆd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would., And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions., L540655, L540654,m198
 I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.," There's so much, and so much of it is dull...", L540658, L540657,m198

" If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.", I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence., L540674, L540673,m198
" In time, Jean Luc.", In time., L540676, L540675,m198
" Hello, Jean Luc.", Why am I here?, L540735, L540734,m198
 What are you doing?, I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. , L540739, L540738,m198
 All of this so you could capture me?," Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.", L540742, L540741,m198
 Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe IÆll snap its ugly head off., What's this all about?, L540746, L540745,m198
" It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...", You're not Reman., L540748, L540747,m198
 And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?, I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is., L540750, L540749,m198
" I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.", I won't defend my life to you., L540752, L540751,m198
 My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?, If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation., L540754, L540753,m198
" Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest."," Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?", L540756, L540755,m198
 It amazes me how little you know yourself.," I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.", L540758, L540757,m198
" You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.", We are., L540925, L540924,m198
" It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.", Why are you here?, L540927, L540926,m198
 To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship., And what of the Enterprise?, L540929, L540928,m198
" I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.", You know that's not possible., L540931, L540930,m198
 I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.," Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.", L540933, L540932,m198
" I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.", Long ago., L540935, L540934,m198
 Not so long.," Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.", L540937, L540936,m198
 The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!, He is what his life has made him!, L540941, L540940,m198
 Yes.," So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?", L540946, L540945,m198
 I don't know., But you want to., L540948, L540947,m198
 That's your life... not mine., Please., L540951, L540950,m198
 ItÆs too late., You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!, L540953, L540952,m198
" I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.", I am., L541024, L541023,m198
" Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.", On my way., L540722, L540721,m198
 Report!," Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!", L540958, L540957,m198
 Target disruptors. Destroy them.," Disruptors are off-line, sir.", L541040, L541039,m198
 Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth., What about Picard?, L541042, L541041,m198
" Our greater goal is more important, brother."," But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...", L541044, L541043,m198
" Well, that sounds relaxing too.", It is... invigorating., L540456, L540455,m198
 So theyÆve got him up and running., He's a very unusual android., L540458, L540457,m198
 My God..., Should I raise shields?, L540544, L540543,m198
 Minimal damage to the Scimitar.," Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.", L540917, L540916,m198
" Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.", We're being hailed., L540960, L540959,m198
 Intruder alert!, Let's go., L541008, L541007,m198
 Are we prepared?," Yes, Praetor.", L540339, L540338,m198
 This is a mistake., He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor., L540678, L540677,m198
" Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.", My time. I'll spend it how I choose., L540680, L540679,m198
 The bond is broken., Find her again., L540718, L540717,m198
 No -- this is wasting time., Do as I tell you!, L540720, L540719,m198
 It's accelerating. You have no more time for games., Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.', L540724, L540723,m198
 How long?, A matter of hours now., L540882, L540881,m198
 How long until we reach the Rift?, Seven minutes., L540885, L540884,m198
 Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop., What?!, L540976, L540975,m198
 Praetor..., FULL STOP AND FIRE !, L540982, L540981,m198
 What is it?!! Focus on your job!!, She is here., L540999, L540998,m198
" Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?", They're holding position., L540322, L540321,m198
 And?," They will obey, Praetor.", L540324, L540323,m198
 How many Warbirds will you need?, None., L540332, L540331,m198
" Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.", The Scimitar will serve my needs., L540334, L540333,m198
 But surely..., I came this far alone ..., L540336, L540335,m198
 Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!, You don't have to understand., L540628, L540627,m198
 And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?, I have a purpose., L540630, L540629,m198
 Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?," Silence, Romulan!", L540632, L540631,m198
" You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guardÆs whip and you'll soon understand patience.", Praetor., L540634, L540633,m198
 The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space., , L540816, L540815,m198
" I thought we discussed patience, Commander."," And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--", L540818, L540817,m198
" Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?", For the moment., L540820, L540819,m198
" Benny, God, take it easy...", I don't want to scare them away., L542517, L542516,m199
 Right in line with that burning tree., I don't see anything., L542522, L542521,m199
" Benny, there's nothing there.", There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses., L542525, L542524,m199
 What did I tell you?, Probably kids., L542530, L542529,m199
 Don't you think you should call a backup?," No, we can handle this.", L542533, L542532,m199
" Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?", I don't think so... , L542545, L542544,m199
 Gate three. It's boarding now., Thank you., L542955, L542954,m199
 What can I do for you folks?, How much are your rooms?, L543085, L543084,m199
 You have one with two beds?, Sure., L543088, L543087,m199
 I'll take that., Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?, L543090, L543089,m199
 Credit card., I'll have to run your card off now., L543092, L543091,m199
 We're only going to be here a few hours..., It's still the full price., L543094, L543093,m199
 Do you have a good map of Death Valley?, We should have. Let me see., L543352, L543351,m199
 Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money., I understand., L543166, L543165,m199
 What do you do?, I make maps., L543168, L543167,m199

 Make any money?, No., L543172, L543171,m199

 No!!! No!!!, He's got a gun!!, L543117, L543116,m199
 Where did you stop last?, What the hell do you think you're doing?, L543146, L543145,m199
 Where did you stop last?, Stay right there..., L543148, L543147,m199
 What was your last stop?, Elmo's..., L543150, L543149,m199
 Where's that?, About five miles back., L543152, L543151,m199
" We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?"," Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?", L542589, L542588,m199
 Recognize this?, It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes., L542619, L542618,m199
 Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit., They must have picked it up in space., L542621, L542620,m199
" It's real, George.", There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?, L542582, L542581,m199
 I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and..., Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?, L542584, L542583,m199
 None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...," Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.", L542586, L542585,m199
" We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.", I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need., L542592, L542591,m199
 Contain it and get back to me., What do you mean by 'contain?', L542595, L542594,m199
 Then it's not an accident that they found us., We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact., L542623, L542622,m199
 Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?, We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for., L542625, L542624,m199
" That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us."," We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.", L542627, L542626,m199
" Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone."," You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.", L542629, L542628,m199
" George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.", When can we expect containment?, L542744, L542743,m199
" Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...", It's in a green Mustang?, L542746, L542745,m199
 Why did you let it get into a populated area?, It's taken on a disguise., L542751, L542750,m199
 Clarify that., It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband., L542753, L542752,m199
 The extraterrestrial now looks like this., Oh shit!!!, L542756, L542755,m199
" You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...", I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk., L542883, L542882,m199
" I don't like it, George...", Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?, L542885, L542884,m199
 It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed..., We don't know what else to do. We need results., L542887, L542886,m199
" You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.", I'm gonna be here if you need anything., L542889, L542888,m199
 We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.," I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.", L543133, L543132,m199
 I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.," George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.", L543135, L543134,m199
" Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...", Is that what's affecting your performance?, L543138, L543137,m199
" I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it."," You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.", L543140, L543139,m199
 Hello George., Shermin..., L543334, L543333,m199
 What's all this for?, We have a new directive. I'm taking over., L543336, L543335,m199
 We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time., Washington thinks it's too late for that., L543338, L543337,m199
 I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you., You're not hearing me., L543340, L543339,m199
" You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.", We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear., L543342, L543341,m199
 That's the chance we have to take.," No, we don't.", L543344, L543343,m199
 Then you're going to have to do it without me.," You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.", L543346, L543345,m199
 No deal., I'm afraid we can't let you go., L543413, L543412,m199
" George... Do you hear me, George?", What?, L543431, L543430,m199
 I just retired., Shermin!! Shermin!!!, L543433, L543432,m199

" You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.", No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride., L543211, L543210,m199
 Is the man who kidnapped you there now?, I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home., L543214, L543213,m199

 Then let me go. You don't need me., No., L542927, L542926,m199
 Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go., When we get here., L542930, L542929,m199
 The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells..., Is that a baby?, L542958, L542957,m199
 Yes., A baby is a new person?, L542960, L542959,m199
 Eh... yes..., Do you have a baby?, L542962, L542961,m199
 No... The closest..., Why?, L542964, L542963,m199
 I'd love to have a baby. But I can't..., Why?, L542966, L542965,m199
 But I must go here., I know that. But the buses don't go there., L542969, L542968,m199
 What is hitchhike?," That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'", L542971, L542970,m199
 Say it.," 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'", L542973, L542972,m199
 The driver will..., But I speak English., L542975, L542974,m199
" Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.", I do not speak English., L542977, L542976,m199
" Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'..."," 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?", L542979, L542978,m199
 You want this ticket?, Yes., L542981, L542980,m199
" 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'"," You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...", L542986, L542985,m199
 Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride., The car will stop?, L542988, L542987,m199
 When do I get to Lathrop Wells?, Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and..., L542991, L542990,m199

 Goodbye., What?, L543010, L543009,m199
 What happened?, I was afraid., L543015, L543014,m199
 Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?, It was a mistake., L543041, L543040,m199
 You thought we were a different planet?!, No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and..., L543043, L543042,m199
" Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'"," We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.", L543045, L543044,m199
 You did? That's funny. So did we., Yes?, L543047, L543046,m199
 Yes.," We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...", L543049, L543048,m199
 The captain..., The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed., L543051, L543050,m199
" Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?", I don't understand 'friend.', L543053, L543052,m199
 A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with..., He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship., L543055, L543054,m199
" The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.", I understand., L543057, L543056,m199
 Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home., What is hell?, L543059, L543058,m199
 It's bad., He will., L543061, L543060,m199
 What are you doing?, Are you my friend?, L543063, L543062,m199
 Yes., I am your friend., L543065, L543064,m199
 Nobody knows., Why?, L543069, L543068,m199
 I like this music., I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?, L543072, L543071,m199
 Do you have music up there?, Yes., L543075, L543074,m199
 I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?, I do not want to., L543077, L543076,m199
 I am not a good singer., That was beautiful., L543081, L543080,m199
 You liked my singing?, Yes. Sing some more., L543083, L543082,m199
 Put that back., But I have never seen this before. I am not complete., L543097, L543096,m199
 You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you., On the radio they say it's good., L543106, L543105,m199
 The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?, No. Get in., L543109, L543108,m199
 You can have one., I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer., L543111, L543110,m199
 Are you angry at me?, No. I'm just not tired. Let's go., L543113, L543112,m199
 I told you goodbye. Why are you here?, The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back., L543267, L543266,m199
 This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back., The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on., L543269, L543268,m199
" If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me."," Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.", L543271, L543270,m199
 I will go. But not you.," You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.", L543273, L543272,m199
 I don't want you to be hurt., Come on., L543275, L543274,m199
 Where are you going?, I must meet my ship., L543282, L543281,m199
 Why can't we wait here for a ride?, I feel better if I move., L543284, L543283,m199
 Asshole!!, Where did you learn that?, L543288, L543287,m199
 We're not going to get a ride tonight., I can't stay on this planet., L543291, L543290,m199
 No one's traveling in this weather., You promised you would get me to my ship., L543293, L543292,m199
 I will. I will. We still have another day., You promised., L543295, L543294,m199
 What are you saying?, You can stop. I will go on alone., L543298, L543297,m199
 Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?, I used the last one to jump off the cliff..., L543302, L543301,m199
 Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.," I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.", L543304, L543303,m199
 You are cold., You're damn right I am., L543308, L543307,m199
 What?, Nothing., L543314, L543313,m199
 Good morning., Horses., L543316, L543315,m199
" You don't forget anything, do you?", No., L543318, L543317,m199
 Hello... hello. How are you this morning?, Do they talk?!, L543320, L543319,m199
" No, they don't talk... We talk to them.", I understand., L543322, L543321,m199
" Oh, you're pretty...", I gave you a baby last night., L543324, L543323,m199
 They are beautiful.," Yes, they are.", L543326, L543325,m199
" You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.", But..., L543328, L543327,m199
 It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have., I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby., L543330, L543329,m199
 The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling., You don't make money gambling. You lose it., L543350, L543349,m199
" May I have twenty-five cents, please?", What for?, L543354, L543353,m199
" Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.", I understand.  Thank you., L543357, L543356,m199
 This is crazy. We don't have time for this., I know how to gamble now., L543359, L543358,m199
 You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship., I want to get money for you and the baby., L543361, L543360,m199
 I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.," Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.", L543363, L543362,m199
 The cook again?, Yes., L543365, L543364,m199
 It'll tell you pretty much everything about us..., This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this., L543368, L543367,m199
 Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary., I understand., L543370, L543369,m199
" It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything."," Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.", L543372, L543371,m199
 What will you say about us?, I will say that we can be friends., L543374, L543373,m199

 The yellow one.," Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.", L543392, L543391,m199
 Where do you think you're going?," Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.", L543416, L543415,m199
 Well..., I must go., L543438, L543437,m199
 What do I do now?, You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.', L543440, L543439,m199

 You sure this is your car?, My grandmother's rich., L543230, L543229,m199
" Slow down, slow down."," Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.", L543232, L543231,m199
 I told you I'm looking for someone.," In the cars, too?!", L543234, L543233,m199
 I don't know where he is., This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast., L543236, L543235,m199
 They after you?," What? No, of course not.", L543238, L543237,m199
" I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all."," If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?", L543255, L543254,m199
 The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way., Pull over. I've got to get back there., L543258, L543257,m199
 Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody., It's easier not to tell if you don't know., L543260, L543259,m199
 Wait. Could I have your autograph?, Sure., L543262, L543261,m199
 I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you., Don't worry. I'll be all right., L543264, L543263,m199

 I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together., Doesn't make sense., L543038, L543037,m199
 Tell him I'm not here., I did., L543130, L543129,m199
" You get that, Lyman?", We're ready., L543249, L543248,m199
 I'm telling you they're probably friendly., Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say..., L542604, L542603,m199

" You have no conception of this, do you?"," You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this...

 Can you see under the faceplate?, No., L542561, L542560,m199
 There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then..., Wait'll you see it., L542563, L542562,m199
 We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared., Was there visual contact?, L542565, L542564,m199
" No, sir. Radar.", It could have been anything., L542567, L542566,m199

" We have nothing to talk about, Lenny."," Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.", L550931, L550930,m200
 Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.," Leave him alone, Tran.", L550936, L550935,m200

 You said you were going to get her out of this.," Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  ""Stand by your man"". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.", L551060, L551059,m200
 He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone., I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--, L551062, L551061,m200

" Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself."," It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.", L550955, L550954,m200
" That's a good one, coming from you."," Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.", L550957, L550956,m200
 He has his uses too., What?  He gonna record you on his label?, L550959, L550958,m200

" You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.", Iris is dead.  She was murdered., L551042, L551041,m200
 Who did it?," Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.", L551044, L551043,m200

 What's going on?," Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.", L551282, L551281,m200
 How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?, We should talk alone., L551285, L551284,m200
 So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do., Yeah... he figured out what to do all right., L551297, L551296,m200
 You think Tran killed her?, The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there., L551299, L551298,m200

 What?  Right Here?, Step into my office., L550769, L550768,m200
" Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?"," You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--", L550773, L550772,m200
 You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders., Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money., L550779, L550778,m200

 That's not sayin' much., It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle., L550789, L550788,m200
" You were lucky, Max."," Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!", L550792, L550791,m200
 Naw.  She won't call me.," Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.", L550795, L550794,m200
" I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes."," Hey, Iris, you okay?", L550798, L550797,m200
" See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense."," Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.", L550817, L550816,m200

" Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy."," I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.", L550972, L550971,m200
 You should feel like shit.," I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?", L550974, L550973,m200
" Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.", I'm on her., L550976, L550975,m200
 You alright?  Y'okay?," Yeah.  No, not really.", L551013, L551012,m200
 Let's work it., Not now... I don't want to think about it--, L551015, L551014,m200
" Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?", He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her..., L551017, L551016,m200
 And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again., He records himself raping and killing her--, L551019, L551018,m200
 But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--," So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.", L551021, L551020,m200
 So've I.  Too much., But this is a bad one., L551023, L551022,m200
 Top ten.," He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.", L551025, L551024,m200
 That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy., Why me?, L551029, L551028,m200
" Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed."," W'sup, Max?", L551112, L551111,m200
 Faith OK?, Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash., L551115, L551114,m200
 Looks like she was holding out.," Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.", L551117, L551116,m200
 He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.," I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.", L551119, L551118,m200
 Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.," You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!", L551248, L551247,m200
 He's been cooked-off, Is he dead?, L551251, L551250,m200
 Whattya mean?, All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff., L551259, L551258,m200
 What stuff?," Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.", L551261, L551260,m200
 Jesus.," Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.", L551263, L551262,m200

" He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.", What do you mean?, L551316, L551315,m200
 Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.," This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?", L551318, L551317,m200
 2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her., I intend to., L551321, L551320,m200
" No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.", Only way I could stand your ties., L551392, L551391,m200
 I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice., Where's Faith?, L551394, L551393,m200
 I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran., What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?, L551396, L551395,m200
 You just did., Jesus!, L551398, L551397,m200
" So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.", That's pretty much the way it happened., L551401, L551400,m200
" Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?", That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy., L551403, L551402,m200
 Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?, You bet.  Did you like it?, L551405, L551404,m200
 Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect., I won't say anything., L551408, L551407,m200
" Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times."," And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.", L551411, L551410,m200
" No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway."," You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.", L551413, L551412,m200
 So there never was a death squad., Naawww., L551417, L551416,m200
 Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.," Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.", L551419, L551418,m200
 How did you hook up with Faith?," This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...", L551421, L551420,m200
" Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny."," Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.", L550671, L550670,m200
 How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?, With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig., L550674, L550673,m200
" Yeah, but how'd it get to you?"," I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?", L550676, L550675,m200
" Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.", Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black., L550678, L550677,m200
 I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.," Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.", L550680, L550679,m200
 So lay it off to somebody else.," Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...", L550682, L550681,m200
" Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'."," Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.", L550684, L550683,m200
" Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'."," Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'", L550687, L550686,m200
" I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.", Ha!  That's for fucking sure., L550689, L550688,m200
 Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.," Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.", L551142, L551141,m200
" Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...", What?, L551147, L551146,m200
" Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.", Who was just here?, L551149, L551148,m200
" Iris, man.  Pay attention."," Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!", L551151, L551150,m200
" Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.", What clip?  What was it?, L551153, L551152,m200
" I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'", She never gave me a tape., L551155, L551154,m200
" You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?"," You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.", L550917, L550916,m200
" Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist."," Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.", L550922, L550921,m200

 Charm.," Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?", L551053, L551052,m200
 It's alright.  He means it., I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?, L551055, L551054,m200
 Nero., Strickland., L550866, L550865,m200

 It was a tough call., I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops., L551243, L551242,m200

 I guess., And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?, L551335, L551334,m200
" I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker.

 Alright.  We're going up., And do what?  Take on his whole posse?, L551351, L551350,m200

 Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks., This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys., L551256, L551255,m200
 So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!, Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it., L551274, L551273,m200

 You were right. He found me., And you're working with him?, L562819, L562818,m201
 I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory., Does one exist?, L562821, L562820,m201
" Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.", Koessler doesn't know any of this?, L562823, L562822,m201
 I'd be real careful if I were you.," It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.", L562826, L562825,m201
" It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong."," They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.", L562828, L562827,m201
 You're putting me in a difficult position.," I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.", L562830, L562829,m201
" Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?"," Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.", L562832, L562831,m201
 But why this pattern?," Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.", L562848, L562847,m201
" Tom, you okay?", Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that., L562850, L562849,m201
 You okay?," Yeah, of course.", L562852, L562851,m201
 It's quite advanced.," Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as ""burn residue."" Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.", L562857, L562856,m201
 All the same killer?, Low calls him Suspect Zero., L562859, L562858,m201
 Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so., That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low., L562861, L562860,m201
" You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going."," But it was your idea: ""use Zero,"" you said, use Zero to get Low.", L562863, L562862,m201
 I haven't changed anything.  Damn., I..., L562866, L562865,m201
 Jaime --, It's a truck. A refrigerated truck., L562869, L562868,m201
" Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.", How are we going to find him?, L562871, L562870,m201
 What happened?, I'm going to Amarillo., L562907, L562906,m201
 Agent..., Kulok., L562930, L562929,m201
 Unlock these cuffs., Sit back., L562955, L562954,m201
 Mack must think Zero has a police band.," Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.", L562961, L562960,m201
 Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?, I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you., L562963, L562962,m201
" Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.", No weapon., L562982, L562981,m201
" Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.", I'll be back., L562986, L562985,m201
 How did you know Speck was a killer?, The little piggie speaks., L562396, L562395,m201
 Who are you?," I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.", L562398, L562397,m201
 Agent Mackelway?, Yes., L562749, L562748,m201
 This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.," Yes, sir.", L562751, L562750,m201
 Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.," I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.", L562760, L562759,m201
 How's the arm?," I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.", L562762, L562761,m201
 He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?, He's moved on to TV., L562764, L562763,m201
" What was your weakness, sir?"," I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.", L562767, L562766,m201
 Suspect Zero?," Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.", L562769, L562768,m201
 So you went underground?," Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?", L562771, L562770,m201
 I don't carry it with me., You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says., L562773, L562772,m201
 Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.," The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.", L562776, L562775,m201
" It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.", Zero killed them all?, L562779, L562778,m201
" Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?", Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms., L562781, L562780,m201
" After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.", How do you know who's real and who's not?, L562783, L562782,m201
" And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.", You knew it was me all along?, L562785, L562784,m201
" There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.", I already have an employer., L562788, L562787,m201
" If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.", Who told you about her?, L562790, L562789,m201
" You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.", It was the mall., L562792, L562791,m201
" I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --", Those were just fantasies., L562794, L562793,m201
 We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone., Maybe you should back off., L562796, L562795,m201
" This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.", You? You went by the book?, L562798, L562797,m201
 Is he dead?, Yeah., L562991, L562990,m201
 Was it Zero?, Yeah., L562994, L562993,m201
" [Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]", Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel., L562478, L562477,m201
 [Reality very risky.], Whatever happened to MyDick?, L562532, L562531,m201

" [If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]"," Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.", L562717, L562716,m201
 Let's talk about Zero.," [Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]", L562722, L562721,m201
 I want to help you.," [Not the heart, the watch.]", L562724, L562723,m201
 I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation., [Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.], L562726, L562725,m201
 Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?, [You tell me.], L562728, L562727,m201
 George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler., [What does the file say?], L562730, L562729,m201
 I want to go live with you., [And I want to go back to Needlepoint.], L562732, L562731,m201

" Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.", So you're the new meat?, L562202, L562201,m201
" Yes, sir.", What did you do to end up here?, L562204, L562203,m201
" I believe it's in my file, sir."," Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?", L562206, L562205,m201
 Thomas Mackelway.," Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?", L562208, L562207,m201
" Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.", Sounds like fun., L562210, L562209,m201
" ""Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center."" Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here."," I screwed up twice, sir.", L562212, L562211,m201
 I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?," Four hundred and sixty, sir.", L562214, L562213,m201
" ""Attitude Adjustment Issues"" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?", I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request., L562216, L562215,m201
" This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket."," I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.", L562218, L562217,m201
" Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?"," Yes, sir.", L562223, L562222,m201
 Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon., This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out., L562264, L562263,m201
 Koessler?, The same., L562266, L562265,m201
 No.," Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.", L562302, L562301,m201
" ""MyDick?""", MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name., L562355, L562354,m201
 I don't...," Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the ""item"" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.", L562357, L562356,m201
 Speck is dead., I talked to him., L562359, L562358,m201
 But why attack an Agent?," He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.", L562420, L562419,m201
 How far is Amarillo?, 350 miles., L562883, L562882,m201
" Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo."," Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?", L562886, L562885,m201
 I don't think you understand.," What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?", L562892, L562891,m201
 Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low., Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway., L562894, L562893,m201
" I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.", Murman!, L562970, L562969,m201
 He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.," Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.", L562972, L562971,m201
" You want to ""profile"" me? Find out what makes me ""tick""? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?", It's over for you., L562977, L562976,m201
" You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!", Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here., L591882, L591881,m211
 The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!, What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it., L591884, L591883,m211
 What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?, I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting., L591886, L591885,m211
 Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?, He'll be there at 8:30., L591888, L591887,m211
" Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?"," Yes, sir -- it certainly does!", L591890, L591889,m211
 You wrote this?, It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time., L591722, L591721,m211
 Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?," Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.", L591726, L591725,m211
 How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?, I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship., L591728, L591727,m211
" As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have."," My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.", L591730, L591729,m211
" You have faith, Professor Barnhardt"," It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.", L591733, L591732,m211
 I would like to explain something of my mission here., That was my first question., L591735, L591734,m211
 It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets., Yes -- that is true., L591737, L591736,m211
" In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.", If you mean that you are afraid of us--, L591739, L591738,m211
" We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.", These other planets -- do they have peace and security?, L591741, L591740,m211
" We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos."," We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?", L591743, L591742,m211
" I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.", Would you care to be more specific?, L591745, L591744,m211
 I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful., I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?, L591748, L591747,m211
 What -- what sort of action do you mean?," Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.", L591750, L591749,m211
" Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.", That's what I came to see you about., L591752, L591751,m211
 It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world., I leave that in your hands., L591754, L591753,m211
 You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?, No -- not at all., L591756, L591755,m211
 What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?, My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house., L591758, L591757,m211
 I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy., I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting., L591760, L591759,m211
" One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?"," I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.", L591762, L591761,m211
 Such power exists?, I assure you such power exists., L591764, L591763,m211
 The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--, Yes., L591766, L591765,m211
" Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?", Yes -- of course., L591768, L591767,m211
 Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet., That can easily be arranged., L591770, L591769,m211
 I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything., Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something., L591772, L591771,m211
 Maybe a little demonstration., Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?, L591774, L591773,m211
" Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man."," I think we've all been hearing too much about ""space men.""", L591524, L591523,m211
" Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!"," That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.", L591528, L591527,m211
 Hi Mom!," Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.", L591663, L591662,m211
" Did you have a nice day, dear?"," Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?", L591667, L591666,m211
" Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.", Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?, L591677, L591676,m211
 We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--, Professor Barnhardt., L591680, L591679,m211
" Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?"," Of course, dear.", L591682, L591681,m211
" Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.", Okay., L591807, L591806,m211
 Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter," Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.", L591809, L591808,m211
 Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?, Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic., L591811, L591810,m211
 Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?," What do you mean, dear?", L591813, L591812,m211
" I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?"," No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.", L591815, L591814,m211
 Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?," I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!", L591823, L591822,m211
 Tell me what?," I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!", L591825, L591824,m211
" Now, Bobby, just a minute--"," Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!", L591827, L591826,m211
" Bobby, you've been dreaming again."," No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!", L591829, L591828,m211
" Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house."," Yes, I have!", L591836, L591835,m211
 He gave these to you?," Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.", L591844, L591843,m211
" Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?"," Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.", L591847, L591846,m211
" Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?"," Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!", L591853, L591852,m211
 Are you an FBI man?, No -- I'm afraid not., L591522, L591521,m211
 Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?," Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.", L591572, L591571,m211
" Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world."," He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?", L591577, L591576,m211
 Sure. Right near where my mother works., Where is that?, L591579, L591578,m211
" Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.", I shouldn't be at all surprised., L591582, L591581,m211
" Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?"," Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.", L591584, L591583,m211
 I thought that was only for bombs.," No. It's for a lot of other things, too.", L591586, L591585,m211
 You think it can go faster than an F- 36?, Yes -- I think so., L591588, L591587,m211
 Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster., Gee! How could they make a landing?, L591591, L591590,m211
 You think they'll ever find him?," I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.", L591595, L591594,m211
 Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?, Velocity is the time rate of change of position., L591597, L591596,m211
 Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.," You're just kidding, aren't you?", L591600, L591599,m211
 Wouldn't you like to meet him?," Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.", L591602, L591601,m211
 What does that mean?, It's a problem in celestial mechanics., L591608, L591607,m211
 Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer., He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way., L591610, L591609,m211
 Did all these people die in wars?, Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?, L591625, L591624,m211
 No -- I'm afraid not.," Mr. Carpenter"" -- you don't seem to know about anything.", L591627, L591626,m211
" I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.", Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?, L591629, L591628,m211
 Go to the movies., All right., L591634, L591633,m211
 No foolin'? Will you?," Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?", L591636, L591635,m211
 I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars., No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?, L591638, L591637,m211
 Gee -- those look like diamonds!, Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out., L591640, L591639,m211
 Bet they're worth about a million dollars., Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?, L591642, L591641,m211
" Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter."," Why not, Bobby?", L591646, L591645,m211
 Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady., Mr. Brady's a cop., L591665, L591664,m211
 We certainly did., We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--, L591669, L591668,m211
" Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story."," We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.", L591674, L591673,m211
" All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract."," Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.", L591802, L591801,m211
 Bobby -- have you a flashlight?, Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight., L591818, L591817,m211
" What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?"," Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.", L591820, L591819,m211
" The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs -û heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.", And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?, L591484, L591483,m211
" Oh, I'd say forty-five.", He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight., L591486, L591485,m211
 I don't believe it., Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty., L591488, L591487,m211
 How does he explain that?, He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor., L591490, L591489,m211
 My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu., Just Klaatu., L591435, L591434,m211
 The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--," Sit down, Mr. Harley.", L591437, L591436,m211
 I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?, About five months -- your months., L591439, L591438,m211
 You must have come a long way., About 250 million of your miles., L591441, L591440,m211
 Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from., From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors., L591443, L591442,m211
 It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.," I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.", L591445, L591444,m211
 The present situation?, I mean the reasons for my coming here., L591447, L591446,m211
" We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?"," I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.", L591449, L591448,m211
 Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--," This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.", L591451, L591450,m211
 I -- I'm not sure I understand--, I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth., L591453, L591452,m211
 I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances., I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?, L591455, L591454,m211
 You know about the United Nations?," We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.", L591457, L591456,m211
 You must have a rather strange impression of us., The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle., L591459, L591458,m211
 I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--," I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.", L591461, L591460,m211
 I was only hoping to make you understand., My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth., L591463, L591462,m211
 Perhaps if you could explain a little--," I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?", L591465, L591464,m211
 We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations., Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?, L591467, L591466,m211
 I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results., Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are., L591471, L591470,m211
 Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around., Thank you... Have you any news?, L591501, L591500,m211
 I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--, It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world., L591504, L591503,m211
" Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President", I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions., L591506, L591505,m211
" Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.", I can judge only by what I see., L591508, L591507,m211
 Your impatience is quite understandable., I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it., L591510, L591509,m211
" Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.", Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible., L591513, L591512,m211
" We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.", There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?, L591560, L591559,m211
" Well, we could--"," There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.", L591562, L591561,m211
 It was a wonderful day., You still haven't answered my question., L591656, L591655,m211
" You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.", The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--, L591658, L591657,m211
 You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it., A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think., L591660, L591659,m211
 Hello--, You ready?, L591789, L591788,m211
 I will be in just a minute., The picture starts at eight-fifty., L591791, L591790,m211
 I was talking to Mr. Carpenter., I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding., L591793, L591792,m211
" Oh, Tom, that was awful."," I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?", L591799, L591798,m211
 He's not there.  But look what I found in his room, Is it real?, L591840, L591839,m211
 I wonder if we ought to--, Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight., L591849, L591848,m211
 You think it's all right for you to stay here?, I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight., L591851, L591850,m211
 I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.," I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.", L591861, L591860,m211
 Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--, Come on in., L591933, L591932,m211
" I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.", What about him?, L591935, L591934,m211
" Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?"," All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.", L591937, L591936,m211
 How do you know?, Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody., L591939, L591938,m211
 Are you crazy? After what happened today?, You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is., L591941, L591940,m211
 Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.," That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.", L591943, L591942,m211
 He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in., But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for., L591945, L591944,m211
" He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.", Is that what you're thinking about?, L591947, L591946,m211
" Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!", I don't care about the rest of the world!, L591952, L591951,m211
 You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers., I feel different right now., L591954, L591953,m211
 You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!, I'm not going to marry anybody., L591956, L591955,m211
 I don't know how to thank you., I enjoyed every minute of it., L591671, L591670,m211
 Everyone seems so-- , Jittery is the word., L591780, L591779,m211
 Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery., He has his homework to keep him occupied., L591782, L591781,m211
" He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.", Naturally I think so., L591784, L591783,m211
" Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?"," Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.", L591787, L591786,m211
 Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.," Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.", L591795, L591794,m211
" Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight."," Goodnight, my dear.", L591805, L591804,m211
 Oh -- hello--, May I see you for a minute?, L591856, L591855,m211
 I -- I was Just going to lunch., May I walk out with you?, L591858, L591857,m211
 I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--, Yes--?, L591863, L591862,m211
 I want to know what he told you last night., I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination., L591865, L591864,m211
 What is it you want?," Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--", L591869, L591868,m211
 What happened?, What time is it?, L591871, L591870,m211
 Just twelve., We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes., L591873, L591872,m211
 We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse., It won't work., L591875, L591874,m211
 Why not?, You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world., L591877, L591876,m211
 You hold great hope for this meeting.," I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.", L591912, L591911,m211
 It must be twelve-thirty., Yes -- Just exactly., L591914, L591913,m211
 Where are you going now?, Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--, L591916, L591915,m211
" No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.", Who?, L591918, L591917,m211
 I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting., Where is the meeting going to be?, L591962, L591961,m211
 It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's., I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me., L591967, L591966,m211
" Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?"," There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: ""Klaatu barada nikto."" Please repeat that.", L591969, L591968,m211
" ""Klaatu barada nikto.""", Remember those words., L591971, L591970,m211
 Hello., I -- I thought you were--, L591980, L591979,m211
 I was., You mean he has the power of life and death?, L591982, L591981,m211
 No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.," This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.", L591984, L591983,m211
 But how -- how long--?, How long will I live?  That no one can say., L591986, L591985,m211
 We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with., He'll have you -- and Tom., L591992, L591991,m211
 No. That's all finished., I'm sorry., L591994, L591993,m211
 How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?, He'll catch on to it in no time now., L591616, L591615,m211
 How did you get in here? And what do you want?, We came to see Professor Barnhardt., L591618, L591617,m211
" Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.", You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me., L591620, L591619,m211
 Is it worth anything?, I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?, L591902, L591901,m211
 That's what I wanted you to tell me., There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world., L591904, L591903,m211
 You sure about that?, Would you like to sell it?, L591906, L591905,m211
" No -- no, thanks.", I'd give you a very good price., L591908, L591907,m211
" The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.", I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem., L591692, L591691,m211
" Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.", That's right., L591694, L591693,m211
 I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army., In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself., L591696, L591695,m211
 But I suppose you know the answer.," It's really quite simple... The three- body problem, you know.", L591698, L591697,m211
" Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?", No -- I'm afraid not., L591700, L591699,m211
" Well, how do I know who you are?", You don't., L591702, L591701,m211
 Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts., They would have killed this man?, L591707, L591706,m211
" People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.", How long will that take?, L591709, L591708,m211
 May I suggest that you call the Professor?," Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!", L591714, L591713,m211
 Sixteen., And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year..., L601795, L601794,m213
 What do you want from us?, Just listen., L601842, L601841,m213
" Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots."," Screw it, I'm going up anyway.", L601888, L601887,m213
 All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol., Let's load 'em., L602032, L602031,m213
 Maybe dinner., Dogs don't eat each other., L602035, L602034,m213
 Where these tracks headed?, Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean., L602040, L602039,m213
" What do you mean ""got"" to the dog?"," It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.", L601931, L601930,m213
" Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?"," No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...", L601945, L601944,m213
 That night?, Yeah., L601947, L601946,m213
 What was he doing in the rec room?," Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.", L601949, L601948,m213
" Well, where was he?  Where did he go?", Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him., L601951, L601950,m213
" How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?", Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half..., L601955, L601954,m213
 What the hell you looking at me like that for?, Nothing.  Nothing at all., L601957, L601956,m213
" Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?", I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog., L601890, L601889,m213
 Couldn't make much of it myself., I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?, L601894, L601893,m213
 Sure.  You think there's a connection?, Maybe., L601896, L601895,m213
" Look, I know it's hard to believe...", So what's our problem?, L601937, L601936,m213
 ... It could have gotten to somebody..., Anybody sick?, L601959, L601958,m213
" Listen to me, Garry.  Please...", If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo..., L601968, L601967,m213
 Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...," Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.", L601972, L601971,m213
 You can't let anybody leave!," I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!", L601974, L601973,m213
 Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or..., Finish what?, L601926, L601925,m213

 Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway., What can I do?  Tell me what to do., L604358, L604357,m214
" Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?", Vox..., L604360, L604359,m214
 I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long., I won't leave you like this., L604362, L604361,m214
 Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment., I don't understand., L604364, L604363,m214

 What's your name?, Alexander., L604286, L604285,m214
" Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --", You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --, L604288, L604287,m214
" No, we created the Morlocks.", Created?, L604290, L604289,m214
 You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs., As slaves., L604292, L604291,m214
" And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.", How do you control the Morlocks?, L604295, L604294,m214
 We make them see what we wish., How?, L604297, L604296,m214
 And what of the Eloi?, They survived above.  Became what they are., L604300, L604299,m214
 No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.," I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more ""human"" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.", L604302, L604301,m214
 But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --," And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.", L604304, L604303,m214
 What?, Go back to where you came from.  Or die here., L604309, L604308,m214
 Why would you let me go back?, Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past., L604311, L604310,m214
 Say I just come back again?," Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.", L604313, L604312,m214
 Why?, We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue., L604320, L604319,m214
 So you take their best..., When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated., L604322, L604321,m214
 You took her because she helped me., Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become., L604324, L604323,m214
 She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works., A man can change his history., L604326, L604325,m214
 Now will you go?, No..., L604329, L604328,m214
 If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger..., No..., L604333, L604332,m214
 That was a foolish thing to do., I'm a foolish man., L604342, L604341,m214

 I'm tired of running.," Oh, you won't be running for long...", L604347, L604346,m214

 And why not?, Because..., L604351, L604350,m214
 It's spectacular...," Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.", L603752, L603751,m214
 I've only read about them -- and the new internals.," Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.", L603754, L603753,m214
 How do you keep the water temperature stable?, There's a cantilevered gasket on the --, L603756, L603755,m214
" God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?", I just love mechanical things., L603758, L603757,m214
" Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.", Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment., L603760, L603759,m214
 Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night., You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty., L603762, L603761,m214

" The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?", No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!, L603936, L603935,m214
" Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --", Why is it -- breaking up?, L603938, L603937,m214

" As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is ""Applied Mathematics and Engineering"", am I correct?"," Exactly correct, sir.", L603671, L603670,m214
" Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!", Imagine that., L603673, L603672,m214
 But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.," Well... perhaps I have ""deviated"" the tiniest bit.", L603675, L603674,m214
 Might I ask why?, Because the assigned curriculum is boring., L603677, L603676,m214
" Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.", Do they?, L603679, L603678,m214
 And roosters.," No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't ""inspiring"" to you.  Perhaps they don't ""challenge"" you --", L603683, L603682,m214
" No, sir --"," Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.", L603685, L603684,m214

 But... what about Starks?, What about Starks?, L583515, L583514,m215
 Should we be..., Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes., L583517, L583516,m215

 I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?, Depends on what you're seeing., L583463, L583462,m215
 You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?," [Beat] You don't believe me, do you?", L583465, L583464,m215
 He's recovering on the third floor., Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!, L583657, L583656,m215
 I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there., In where?, L583679, L583678,m215
 We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to., That wasn't a fucking restraint., L583682, L583681,m215
 Relax., Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here., L583685, L583684,m215

" It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our ""practices"" off to the New Year."," They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?", L583965, L583964,m215
 And what's that?, My business?, L583969, L583968,m215
 Yes., Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison., L583971, L583970,m215

" Becker, how do you sleep at night?", You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug., L583983, L583982,m215
 Who are you?, I think you know. Your eyes say you do., L584028, L584027,m215
 [Beat] You're his son?," No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.", L584030, L584029,m215

 I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer..., I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there., L584037, L584036,m215
 I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out., How?, L584039, L584038,m215
" Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...", Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?, L584042, L584041,m215
 It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...," So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?", L584044, L584043,m215

 I don't understand...," I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?", L584053, L584052,m215
 I didn't put you in Alpine Grove., No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket., L584055, L584054,m215
 Do I know you from somewhere?," You may have known my father, William Starks.", L583874, L583873,m215
" That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.", He didn't either., L583876, L583875,m215
 Did you know my father?," Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?", L583878, L583877,m215
 My father used to talk about you.," Oh yeah, what'd he say?", L583882, L583881,m215
" Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...", That's too bad., L583885, L583884,m215
 I thought you said you never knew your father., I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?, L583887, L583886,m215
 He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it., I never touched your father! I swear!, L583890, L583889,m215
 We're late., I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have., L583742, L583741,m215
 It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about., They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for., L583745, L583744,m215
 What should they be looking for?, They should just be looking harder., L583747, L583746,m215
" Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?", Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now., L583749, L583748,m215
 You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?, I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams., L583496, L583495,m215
 You done with your small talk?, Sure., L583498, L583497,m215
" This is really happening, isn't it?", [Beat] What do you need me to do?, L584133, L584132,m215
 I need to get this letter to someone., I can't take you out of here in your condition..., L584136, L584135,m215
 And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.," No, it hasn't.", L584138, L584137,m215
" I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks.

 I think I can remember what's on them., William Starks. [Beat] Thanks., L583441, L583440,m215
 What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything., [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me., L583616, L583615,m215
" Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.", What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?, L583619, L583618,m215

 How'd he die?," I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.", L583634, L583633,m215
" I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink.

 Do you really believe me?," I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life.

 [Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?, Yes., L583799, L583798,m215
 Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do., I know., L583801, L583800,m215
 Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you., If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?, L583803, L583802,m215
 I didn't kill Officer Harrison., I know., L583805, L583804,m215
 How? Did they figure it out after I died?, No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them., L583807, L583806,m215
 I don't believe a thing she just said.," Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?", L583859, L583858,m215
 I have no idea., You think Lorenson kills you?, L583861, L583860,m215
" Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.", Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with., L583863, L583862,m215
 Why?, Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled., L583865, L583864,m215
 How long do we have?, I don't know., L583893, L583892,m215
 What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy., I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say., L583897, L583896,m215
 Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days., You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't., L583899, L583898,m215

 I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?," I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.", L584011, L584010,m215
 Then why isn't there anyone around?, [Beat] I don't know., L584013, L584012,m215

" If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face."," Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?", L584063, L584062,m215
 Where are we going?, To the hospital., L584065, L584064,m215
 What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?, Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through., L584068, L584067,m215
 Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her., Ok. Ssh. Rest., L584071, L584070,m215
 What?," When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?", L584085, L584084,m215

 I think so., You're bleeding pretty bad there., L584183, L584182,m215
 It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?, I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive., L584185, L584184,m215
 How you doin'?, I'm doing fine., L584194, L584193,m215
" Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?"," It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.", L583834, L583833,m215
 How?, He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him., L583836, L583835,m215

 You were convicted of the crime.," That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.", L583709, L583708,m215
 You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged., No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind., L583711, L583710,m215

 You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.," Believe me, I know.", L583720, L583719,m215

 The future doesn't look different?, No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from., L583925, L583924,m215
 What about the world?, I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life., L583927, L583926,m215

" But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy.

[Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.", L583597, L583596,m215
" They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.", So you never knew your mother?, L583599, L583598,m215

 Do you expect me to believe you?," Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...", L621091, L621090,m221
 I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid., I am Quaid., L621094, L621093,m221

 I'm afraid that's not possible., Why not?, L620429, L620428,m221
 Oh shit....Oh shit..., I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory., L620432, L620431,m221
" Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.", I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there., L620437, L620436,m221
" Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.", Come on...put his head in place., L620439, L620438,m221
 Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull., Nice to meet you., L620379, L620378,m221
 Two-headed monsters?, Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now., L620382, L620381,m221
" So, been married long?", Eight years., L620386, L620385,m221
 I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky., Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars., L620388, L620387,m221
 Your sexual orientation?, Hetero., L620394, L620393,m221

" Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.", Sleazy...and demure., L620401, L620400,m221
 What do you want?," This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.", L620811, L620810,m221
 I'm listening., I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now., L620813, L620812,m221
" Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me."," I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.", L620815, L620814,m221
 Amazing.  Where are we?, At Rekall., L620817, L620816,m221
" You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console."," Oh, I get it", L620819, L620818,m221
 Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.," Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?", L620821, L620820,m221
" I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.", How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?, L620823, L620822,m221
" Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.", Bullshit.  It's all coincidence., L620825, L620824,m221
" What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure", She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall., L620827, L620826,m221
" Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? ""She's real because you dreamed her?""", That's right., L620829, L620828,m221
 You open it., No need to be rude.  I'll do it., L620832, L620831,m221
 Suppose I do...then what?, Swallow this., L620846, L620845,m221
 What is it?," It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.", L620848, L620847,m221
 Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away., Any news of Quaid?, L620630, L620629,m221
 Not since you lost him.," Watch your mouth, Captain.", L620632, L620631,m221

 Richter!  Call from Cohaagen., This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down., L620902, L620901,m221
 Pull them out.," O.K., everybody pull out!", L620908, L620907,m221
" Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break."," Relax, you'll live longer.", L620750, L620749,m221
" If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning."," We don't have much choice then, do we?", L620939, L620938,m221
 Sit down., Where's Kuato?, L620943, L620942,m221
 On his way., You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?, L620945, L620944,m221
 Yeah.," Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.", L620947, L620946,m221
" What, aliens?", You tell me., L620949, L620948,m221
 I don't know.," Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.", L620951, L620950,m221
" You're Kuato, right?", Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him., L620953, L620952,m221
 Shit!, C'mon!, L620977, L620976,m221
 They found us!  Everybody out!, Melina!, L620979, L620978,m221
 Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?, Rekall?, L620321, L620320,m221
 They sell fake memories.," Oh, Rekall.", L620323, L620322,m221
 Yeah.," ""RekallRekallRekall.""  You thinkin' of goin' there?", L620325, L620324,m221
 I don't know.  Maybe., Well don't., L620327, L620326,m221
 Why not?," A friend of mine tried one of their ""special offers""...Nearly got himself lobotomized.", L620329, L620328,m221
 No shit...," Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.", L620331, L620330,m221
" Hey, Quaid!", Harry!, L620448, L620447,m221
 What trip?," You went to Rekall, remember?", L620451, L620450,m221
 I did?," Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.", L620453, L620452,m221
" What are you, my father?", Let me buy you a drink., L620455, L620454,m221
" Harry, what the hell is this?"," Come on, let's go have that drink.", L620459, L620458,m221
 What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!," You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!", L620461, L620460,m221
" You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble."," Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!", L620464, L620463,m221
 Where?, Up to the right., L620532, L620531,m221
 I want that fucker dead., I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady., L620535, L620534,m221
 Are you saying she liked it?, I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it., L620537, L620536,m221
 What was that?  I couldn't hear you., I've got Quaid., L620549, L620548,m221
 Where is he?, Level 2.  Galleria., L620554, L620553,m221

 That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere., I've got him.  The guy in the turban., L620587, L620586,m221
 I've got a weak signal over there., Split up.  Find him., L620612, L620611,m221
 He's not at ground level., Up!, L620617, L620616,m221
 I've got a lock!  There!, Come on!, L620619, L620618,m221

 ...You mean it?, You know I do., L620275, L620274,m221
 Lori...," Yeah, sweetheart?", L620283, L620282,m221

" Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.", Just think about it., L620288, L620287,m221
" Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry", Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists., L620290, L620289,m221
 And you believe him?," All right, forget about it.", L620292, L620291,m221
" Doug, maybe we should take a trip."," Lori, move.", L620296, L620295,m221

" Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?"," Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.", L620307, L620306,m221
 You are somebody.  You're the man I love., Bye., L620309, L620308,m221
 What are you doing?, Some men just tried to kill me!, L620469, L620468,m221
" Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?", No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!, L620471, L620470,m221
 Harry from work...He was the boss.," Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would ""spies"" want to kill you?", L620473, L620472,m221
 I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars., Mars?  You've never even been to Mars., L620475, L620474,m221
" I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...", You went to those brain butchers?!, L620477, L620476,m221
 Let me finish!, What did they do to you?  Tell me!, L620479, L620478,m221
 --I got a trip to Mars.," Oh God, Doug.", L620481, L620480,m221
" Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me..."," Doug, nobody tried to kill you.", L620483, L620482,m221
 You call this a paranoid delusion?!, Doug..., L620487, L620486,m221
 Not talk!  I said TALK!!, I'm not your wife., L620495, L620494,m221
 The hell you're not., I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!, L620497, L620496,m221
 You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?, It was implanted by the Agency., L620499, L620498,m221
 And falling in love?, Implanted., L620501, L620500,m221
" Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?", The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up., L620503, L620502,m221
" O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?", Beats me.  I just work here., L620507, L620506,m221
 But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really., I'm honored., L620509, L620508,m221
" You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.", I didn't know you were so kinky., L620511, L620510,m221
 Clever girl.," Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?", L620514, L620513,m221
 I suppose you're not here either., I'm here at Rekall., L620836, L620835,m221
 I love you., Right.  That's why you tried to kill me., L620838, L620837,m221
 Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me., Bullshit., L620840, L620839,m221
" Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter."," Doug, don't!", L620851, L620850,m221
 Doug...Bob McClane., Nice to meet you., L620341, L620340,m221
" Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...", Mars., L620345, L620344,m221
 Right.  Mars., That a problem?, L620347, L620346,m221
" To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.", I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars., L620349, L620348,m221
" Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.", What's in the two week package?, L620352, L620351,m221
" First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle", How real does it seem?, L620354, L620353,m221
 As real as any memory in your head.," Come on, don't bullshit me.", L620356, L620355,m221
" I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.", What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?, L620358, L620357,m221
 All right.," Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.", L620362, L620361,m221
 No options., Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?, L620364, L620363,m221
 I give up.," You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an ""Ego Trip"".", L620366, L620365,m221
 I'm not interested in that., You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip., L620368, L620367,m221
 Secret agent...How much is that?," Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...", L620372, L620371,m221
 Go on.," I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?", L620374, L620373,m221
 They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!, What's he talking about?, L620420, L620419,m221

" Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?", Blondes., L620745, L620744,m221
 I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!, I guess he didn't., L620755, L620754,m221
 ...What?, There's something I have to tell you..., L620761, L620760,m221
 I don't remember you., What are you talking about?, L620763, L620762,m221
" What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?", Hauser left me a note., L620766, L620765,m221
 Hauser?  You're Hauser., Not any more., L620768, L620767,m221
" Hauser, you're lost your mind."," I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.", L620771, L620770,m221
 This is too weird., Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ..., L620773, L620772,m221
 She wasn't really my wife.," Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.", L620776, L620775,m221
 Forget I said wife., No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies., L620778, L620777,m221
 Why would I lie to you?, Because you're still working for Cohaagen., L620780, L620779,m221
 Don't be ridiculous.," You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.", L620782, L620781,m221
 I think you better leave.," Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.", L620785, L620784,m221
 I'm not falling for it., He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good., L620787, L620786,m221
 I said get out!," Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.", L620791, L620790,m221
 I thought you didn't like me.," If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.", L620870, L620869,m221
 So you dropped by to apologize?, Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!, L620872, L620871,m221
 Now what?, Jump!, L620875, L620874,m221
 By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?," I used to model for 'em, why?", L620878, L620877,m221
" Not bad, for a hooker.", I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover., L620890, L620889,m221
" The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.", I saw them., L620910, L620909,m221
 What can I do?, Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser., L620915, L620914,m221
 Like what?, All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me., L620917, L620916,m221
 I don't need Kuato for that.," Oh, since when?", L620919, L620918,m221
 He's lying., You two-faced-bastard., L621000, L620999,m221
 Are you all right?  Are you still you?, I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?, L621046, L621045,m221
 Where are you going?!, The reactor., L621053, L621052,m221
 What reactor?!, The one in the mine!, L621055, L621054,m221
" Where's this ""reactor"" come from?", Aliens built it., L621060, L621059,m221
 You sure about this?, It's just up ahead., L621063, L621062,m221
 Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.," Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.", L621075, L621074,m221
 The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen., Enough for everybody to breathe?, L621079, L621078,m221
 What's wrong?, I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?, L621100, L621099,m221
 This is the suitcase you gave me., I gave you?, L620573, L620572,m221
 Wait!, What?, L620576, L620575,m221
 ...Who are you?," We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.", L620578, L620577,m221
" Looks almost cold now, don't it?", That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home., L645663, L645662,m226
 Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here., Let's go., L645665, L645664,m226
 It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!, Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew., L645671, L645670,m226
" It's no meteor, that's for sure!", Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!, L645673, L645672,m226
 We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?, We'd be in all the papers!, L645685, L645684,m226
" Hey, how about that!"," We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!", L645687, L645686,m226
" Hey, there - open up!", Come on out!  We're friends!, L645695, L645694,m226
 That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move., Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through., L645923, L645922,m226
 Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno..., All right - I've seen enough!, L645942, L645941,m226
 There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb., Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles., L645944, L645943,m226
" Hey, you!  Better get outa here!", I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors..., L646044, L646043,m226
 There's nobody left around here now., We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!, L646046, L646045,m226
 Hurry up!  Jump in!, There was a girl with them...If I could find her...., L646050, L646049,m226
 You look kinda lost yourself., But I think I know where she'll be...., L646054, L646053,m226
 Is that it over there?," Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.", L645617, L645616,m226
 Did you see it come down?, Yes...I was fishing up in the hills., L645620, L645619,m226
 You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!, Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater., L645622, L645621,m226
 What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?, He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!, L645625, L645624,m226
 You seem to know a lot about him.," Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.", L645627, L645626,m226
 Did it do you any good?," Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?", L645629, L645628,m226
 I'm sorry.  I don't smoke., Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!, L645631, L645630,m226
" Aw, he isn't that good...!", How can you say that when you don't know him!, L645633, L645632,m226
 I do know him...slightly., What's he like?, L645635, L645634,m226
" Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.", I didn't know how to stop you...!, L645638, L645637,m226
 I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!, They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off., L645640, L645639,m226
 They've all stopped at the same time., There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?, L645712, L645711,m226
 How does it happen cars are running?, Automobile ignitions are insulated., L645720, L645719,m226
 The troops are certainly moving in here!, Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!, L645774, L645773,m226
 I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now., You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!, L645776, L645775,m226
" Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren."," Would you like some coffee, General?", L645789, L645788,m226

 You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?, No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!, L645844, L645843,m226
 I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie...., I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western., L645874, L645873,m226
 Is that... machine...?, It's gone now., L645876, L645875,m226
 Where are we?," Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!", L645878, L645877,m226
" I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.", Don't you live at home?, L645881, L645880,m226
" No, on the campus.  I haven't any family."," I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.", L645883, L645882,m226
 A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something., It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now., L645886, L645885,m226
" We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.", But they seem to murder everything that moves...!, L645888, L645887,m226
 I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation..., I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else., L645891, L645890,m226
 I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me., I liked him., L645893, L645892,m226
 He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!," But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.", L645895, L645894,m226

 Nothing there now., It was...  ...one of them!, L645902, L645901,m226
 What was it like?, I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!, L645904, L645903,m226
 Maybe they aren't too sure we're here., They could be as curious about us as we are about them., L645908, L645907,m226
 They've blocked it!," It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!", L645913, L645912,m226
 Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?," Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?", L645982, L645981,m226
 Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!, I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way., L645984, L645983,m226
 My kid brother has one.  You know why?, Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet., L645986, L645985,m226

 I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried..., You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!, L646022, L646021,m226
" That's what knocked the phones out, too.", How could it happen to everybody's watch together?, L645715, L645714,m226
 That needle ain't pointing north!, It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down., L645718, L645717,m226
 What is that gizmo?!, I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet., L645733, L645732,m226
 This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!, It might give us something., L645968, L645967,m226
 A forlorn hope - but there is a chance., It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians., L646014, L646013,m226
 We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!," If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...", L646017, L646016,m226
 Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?, No.  I thought you had them., L646030, L646029,m226
" I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?", Right., L645591, L645590,m226
 It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa., Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one., L645596, L645595,m226
" That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.", I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning., L645598, L645597,m226
" There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!"," So is the town, I notice!", L645783, L645782,m226
 I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate., I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted., L645785, L645784,m226
 Colonel - shooting's no good!, It's always been a good persuader., L645814, L645813,m226
" General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner."," I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.", L645787, L645786,m226
 That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here., Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far., L645793, L645792,m226
" We will, sir!"," From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?", L645802, L645801,m226
 My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.," That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.", L645805, L645804,m226
" Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!", They'll probably move at dawn., L645807, L645806,m226
 That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?, It was nearer than that., L645578, L645577,m226

 He wouldn't open the lock," Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.", L23640, L23639,m236
 Where did it come from?, <u>He's</u> the only one that knows that., L23647, L23646,m236
 Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.," Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.", L23650, L23649,m236
 We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.," Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.", L23659, L23658,m236
 We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.," How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.", L23661, L23660,m236
" God, that smoke's poisonous!", It's eating a hole in the floor!, L23667, L23666,m236
 I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid., But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>., L23678, L23677,m236
 It makes me sick to see him like that., Isn't there some way we can get it off him?, L23690, L23689,m236
 It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive., You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits..., L23706, L23705,m236
 We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose., We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers., L23831, L23830,m236
" It's over, Hunter."," Boy, that's terrific.", L23252, L23251,m236
" That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?", It wouldn't come., L23628, L23627,m236
" Hey now, what is this?", Ask him., L23636, L23635,m236
 There.  Should be coming through about there.," Careful, don't get under it!", L23672, L23671,m236
 I'll do it.  The rest of you continue., I'll come with you., L23712, L23711,m236
" You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.", What do you mean?, L23714, L23713,m236
" Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.", How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead., L23716, L23715,m236
 Now we're in for it., The door was closed.  It must still be in here., L23720, L23719,m236
" No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping."," Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --", L23722, L23721,m236
 Yes?, How's Broussard?, L23736, L23735,m236
 He's running a fever., Still unconscious?, L23738, L23737,m236
 Yes., Can you do anything for him?, L23740, L23739,m236
 The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong., Good., L23742, L23741,m236
 I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.," Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.", L23852, L23851,m236
" Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.", How do we locate the creature?, L23866, L23865,m236
 Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth., Don't be an idiot., L23905, L23904,m236
 We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!, The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out., L23929, L23928,m236
 While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net., Sounds like a rough one., L23935, L23934,m236
 We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level, At least it can't get up here now., L23982, L23981,m236
" Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower."," That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.", L23987, L23986,m236
 We've got six hours left., Oh my God., L24020, L24019,m236
 Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!, I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers., L24029, L24028,m236
 <u>How</u>?, It's time for drastic remedies., L24031, L24030,m236
" If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.", Good!  That's good!, L24050, L24049,m236
 You can't say that, The flamethrower needs more fuel., L24056, L24055,m236
 The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back., Should we go outside and bring him in?, L24072, L24071,m236
 It will be., What we really need is some red meat in here for bait., L24078, L24077,m236
 Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.," Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... ", L24081, L24080,m236
 It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything., Let me go first, L24098, L24097,m236
 The flamethrower!," I can't, the acid will pour out!", L24100, L24099,m236
 Now what's wrong?, I've completely lost their signal., L23510, L23509,m236
 Can you get them back?, I'm trying., L23512, L23511,m236
 What?  What was that?, The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning., L23528, L23527,m236
 I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them., No., L23559, L23558,m236
" What do you mean, no?", We're not going anywhere., L23561, L23560,m236
 But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now., We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board., L23563, L23562,m236
" Why, you chickenshit bastard --", Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!, L23565, L23564,m236
 I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!, How many?, L23597, L23596,m236
 Oh no.," Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!", L23604, L23603,m236
" I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.", I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled., L23643, L23642,m236
 Look at that., What is it -- I can't tell anything --, L23653, L23652,m236
 It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat., Oh... God..., L23655, L23654,m236
 I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him., It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive., L23657, L23656,m236
 What's happening up here?, I think it's fizzled out., L23676, L23675,m236
 This is horrible., Hey!  what about the film?, L23698, L23697,m236
 That must have been when he got it.," The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.", L23702, L23701,m236
 What common objects?," Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?", L23710, L23709,m236
 You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?, It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken., L23975, L23974,m236
 Don't count on it., We sure need this flamethrower., L23993, L23992,m236
 Recognizable!  In that?," In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.", L24002, L24001,m236
 Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?," And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.", L24004, L24003,m236
 ... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.," You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.", L24011, L24010,m236
 We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.," I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.", L24035, L24034,m236
 Blow the ship up?, And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat., L24041, L24040,m236
 What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.," Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.", L24045, L24044,m236
 I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat., We can use the flamethrower., L24053, L24052,m236
 This should do it., I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it., L24076, L24075,m236
" Isn't ""bait"" the word you used?"," Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!", L24083, L24082,m236
" Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.", Is it armed?, L24087, L24086,m236
" If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.", Thanks for the thought. , L24089, L24088,m236
" Sandy, you want to give us some vision?", Feast your eyes., L23263, L23262,m236
 First contact...," Sandy, can you home in on that beam?", L23298, L23297,m236
 What's the frequency?," Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?", L23300, L23299,m236
" I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.", Dell -- show me that on a screen., L23303, L23302,m236
" Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?", Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes., L23369, L23368,m236
" Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?"," Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.", L23375, L23374,m236
 Receiving.," All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?", L23403, L23402,m236
 That way., You lead., L23408, L23407,m236
 What's wrong?, My signal's fading., L23414, L23413,m236
" It's close, real close.", How far?, L23420, L23419,m236
 Air lock?, Who knows?, L23431, L23430,m236
" Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?", That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it..., L23497, L23496,m236
 This looks ancient.," Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.", L23514, L23513,m236
 What'd he say?, I couldn't make it out -- too much interference., L23557, L23556,m236
" If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.", Sun will be down in a minute., L23569, L23568,m236
 Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to., It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something., L23576, L23575,m236
 But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact., Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes., L23578, L23577,m236
" There, it caught!"," Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?", L23582, L23581,m236
" No, it's coming.", Can you see anything?, L23584, L23583,m236
 <u>What is it</u>?," <u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!", L23590, L23589,m236
" Oh God, oh God no.", Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off., L23592, L23591,m236
 It won't come -- it's stuck., What is it?, L23594, L23593,m236
 It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too., Let's let the machine work on him., L23634, L23633,m236
 It's stopped?," Yes, thank heaven.", L23681, L23680,m236
 We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it., Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans., L23683, L23682,m236
" No, thank God... just missed him.", Is it still dripping?, L23687, L23686,m236
 That sounds a little fanciful...," Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...", L23708, L23707,m236
 Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best., They're from a dead civilization, L23758, L23757,m236
 We're going home.  We're in hyperspace., We're going into the freezers now., L23800, L23799,m236
" I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it ""The Snark Log.""", The commander normally has first publication rights., L23806, L23805,m236
 We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.," Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.", L23835, L23834,m236
 How?," Room by room, corridor by corridor.", L23846, L23845,m236
 And what do we do when we find it?," We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.", L23848, L23847,m236
 I thought I'd find you here.," I was thinking of a line from an old poem: ""Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.""  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.", L23854, L23853,m236
" That's the one about the albatross, right?", We can't even radio for help, L23856, L23855,m236
" We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.", Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation., L23858, L23857,m236

 They're getting pretty close now.," All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?", L23954, L23953,m236
 Okay.," And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?", L23956, L23955,m236

" My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!", Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds, L23332, L23331,m236
 Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters., Close..., L23384, L23383,m236
 It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays..., That tube must be depositing it in him., L23695, L23694,m236

 What would you say that was supposed to mean?, Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them..., L23482, L23481,m236

" That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.", So the next step should be --, L24006, L24005,m236
 This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.," Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...", L24009, L24008,m236

 I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open., Can we get to him?, L24023, L24022,m236
 Poor kitty, At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship., L24026, L24025,m236

" Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.", Sounds great., L27509, L27508,m237
" We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.

 I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.," Hey, how about a little nightcap?", L151337, L151336,m314
 I'm really tired.," Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?", L151339, L151338,m314
" No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.", They say sex is great for cramps., L151341, L151340,m314
 What?, I really gotta pee., L151345, L151344,m314
 You should have gone at the restaurant., I didn't have to pee then., L151347, L151346,m314
 My apartment's just such a mess., That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave., L151349, L151348,m314
 Oh come on. Knock it off., Knock what off?, L151351, L151350,m314
 You don't have to pee., Yes I do have to pee!, L151353, L151352,m314
 You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.," I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.", L151355, L151354,m314
 Uh huh. So pee., So pee? Here?, L151357, L151356,m314
" What, you got a date or somethin'?", Since when do you care?, L151288, L151287,m314
 You look different. I mean you look good., You never say that., L151291, L151290,m314
 You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?, No., L151293, L151292,m314
 Look what you did!," Oh my god, I'm sorry!", L151296, L151295,m314
 Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.," I can't help it, it smells so good.", L151298, L151297,m314
" OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?", Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?, L151301, L151300,m314
" Frida, you know you're it for me.", Yeah right... You better go., L151303, L151302,m314
" Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...", You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!, L151305, L151304,m314
 Where'd you get the bike?," I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?", L151480, L151479,m314
 Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in., It's Mark., L151741, L151740,m314
 It's a matter of life and death., This really isn't a good time., L151746, L151745,m314
 I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me., So pay them back and apologize., L151749, L151748,m314
 These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs., You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?, L151751, L151750,m314
 It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened., Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me., L151753, L151752,m314
" Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.", My bra is my biggest supporter., L151755, L151754,m314
 Mark., Yeah?, L151760, L151759,m314
 Wow., Take your shower., L151762, L151761,m314
 The Nielson's?, On your desk., L151215, L151214,m314
 Script coverage?, On your desk., L151217, L151216,m314
 Coffee and..., Your desk., L151219, L151218,m314
" How about a ""Man in Jeopardy"" story?", Did you change your hair?, L151439, L151438,m314
 I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.," Yes, that's what we're looking for.", L151460, L151459,m314
 I think we should do something with strong female characters..., I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk., L151462, L151461,m314
 Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?, Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women., L151870, L151869,m314
 No., No?, L151872, L151871,m314
" No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.", Very well then. Is that all?, L151874, L151873,m314
 When's the last time you saw him?," We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.", L151377, L151376,m314
 I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.," Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.", L151383, L151382,m314
 You busted me., Are you following me?, L151473, L151472,m314
 No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why., Intriguing?, L151475, L151474,m314
 I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag., At least let me give you this back. I washed it., L151477, L151476,m314
 Being a cop has such a warm effect on people., That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me., L151484, L151483,m314
 You wanna get some coffee?, I'm trying to stay away from caffeine., L151487, L151486,m314
 Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off., No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently., L151489, L151488,m314
 Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together., So what book did you buy?, L151491, L151490,m314
" Oh, it's nothing."," No really, I love knowing what people read.", L151493, L151492,m314
 It's stupid., I can forgive you a bestseller., L151495, L151494,m314
 My mom used to get PMS too., Used to? Did it stop finally?, L151497, L151496,m314
" No, she died when I was twelve.", I'm sorry., L151499, L151498,m314
 I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.," Oh my god, by wolves?", L151501, L151500,m314
 We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.," I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.", L151503, L151502,m314
" I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.", Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something., L151506, L151505,m314
 Like what?, You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear., L151508, L151507,m314
 A lot of people don't wear underwear., Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line., L151510, L151509,m314
 How about you? Briefs or boxers?, Briefs., L151513, L151512,m314
 Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up., Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?, L151515, L151514,m314
 I really gotta get going., Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?, L151518, L151517,m314
 Yeah. Maybe., Goodnight., L151520, L151519,m314
 What are those?, Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix., L151532, L151531,m314
 What are they for?, Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets., L151534, L151533,m314
" I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left..."," Okay, you busted me.", L151538, L151537,m314
 What's wrong?," Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?", L151540, L151539,m314
 I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?," No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.", L151545, L151544,m314
" Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?", No. I was doing my laundry., L151647, L151646,m314
 Was there anything in that washer?," No. Nope, nothing in it.", L151651, L151650,m314
" You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?", NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first., L151653, L151652,m314
 Everything okay?, A man killed in Central Park., L151658, L151657,m314
 Uh.... hi!," Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.", L151806, L151805,m314
 You had a date with Carlton?, It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them., L151824, L151823,m314
" No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.", Mark wouldn't hurt a fly., L151845, L151844,m314
 But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?, Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it., L151848, L151847,m314
" No, why?", He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment., L151851, L151850,m314
 Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?, Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?, L151876, L151875,m314
 I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?," No, I got it. It's okay.", L151878, L151877,m314
 What happened?," I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.", L151881, L151880,m314
 I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.," Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.", L151883, L151882,m314
 Except Mark of course., What's that supposed to mean?, L151885, L151884,m314
 Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?," No, but thanks for the warning.", L151887, L151886,m314
 Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country., Interesting possibility., L151889, L151888,m314
" That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, ""You're talking to Betty now"" and we'd leave the house for a few days."," This is a lot worse than ""Betty.""", L151900, L151899,m314
 You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.," No, my bite's a lot worse.", L151902, L151901,m314
 Is it that funny?," No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say ""I love you too"" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.", L151905, L151904,m314
 Is that how you feel?," Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.", L151907, L151906,m314
 You didn't say it., I love you too., L151909, L151908,m314
 What's with the squirt guns?, They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper., L151911, L151910,m314
" You know, I've never seen your cat.", I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely..., L151913, L151912,m314
 Your breasts feel larger., They do? Oh no..., L151941, L151940,m314
 I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs., No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?, L151944, L151943,m314
 Hello?," Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.", L151982, L151981,m314
 NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever., What? Is there someone else?, L151984, L151983,m314
" Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really."," Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?", L151986, L151985,m314
 You at least owe me the truth., You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?, L151988, L151987,m314
" Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.", No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf., L151990, L151989,m314
" If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.", I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!, L151992, L151991,m314
 Go away. I might hurt you., I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you., L152004, L152003,m314
 Peter I love you too but..., I don't think you'll hurt me., L152006, L152005,m314
 How do you know?, I don't think you would. No matter what form you take., L152008, L152007,m314
 I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you., I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?, L152010, L152009,m314
 Be careful!, Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?, L152013, L152012,m314
 No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately., I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me., L152015, L152014,m314
 I knew you wouldn't kill me., Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child., L152019, L152018,m314
 We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems., Worse than this?, L152021, L152020,m314
" Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.", What about... those guys... I might have..., L152023, L152022,m314
 No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves., I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that., L152025, L152024,m314
 I'm going to take a shower., Okay., L152030, L152029,m314
 Here's a towel., Thanks., L152042, L152041,m314
 That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.," Oh, I see... interesting theory.", L151225, L151224,m314
 I think I'm a werewolf., Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?, L151672, L151671,m314
 I ate a guy last night., And how did you feel when you ate this guy?, L151674, L151673,m314
 Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty., We didn't have sex., L151677, L151676,m314
" You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose ""eating him"" as the method of killing?", Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!, L151679, L151678,m314
 It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.," Oh my god, what happened?", L151366, L151365,m314
 Yes... I... we had dinner., Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?, L151373, L151372,m314
" No, it was our first date.", Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral., L151375, L151374,m314
 A kiss? Did you have sex with him?," No, I said it was our first date.", L151379, L151378,m314
 We can get a warrant if you like.," No, take it.", L151388, L151387,m314
 You heard about Carlton Fraser?," Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?", L151822, L151821,m314
 Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive., What makes you think I was the last one?, L151826, L151825,m314
" No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.", You got a dog?, L151830, L151829,m314
" No, I have a cat.", How big?, L151832, L151831,m314
 No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport., Packages of money., L151840, L151839,m314
" So I asked the bartender what ""coyote ugly"" meant. It's like the ""bagger"" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger..."," Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.", L151171, L151170,m314
 He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time., Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms., L151205, L151204,m314
" Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.", She's just so... pathetic., L151561, L151560,m314
 She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous., She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad., L151563, L151562,m314
 I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?, Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky., L151616, L151615,m314
 It's for you. Frida., Tell her I'm eating., L151626, L151625,m314
 I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?, It's so bad she becomes a werewolf., L151682, L151681,m314
 You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?," Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.", L151684, L151683,m314
 Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?, Take some allergy medicine., L151686, L151685,m314
 You can't believe this bullshit.," She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.", L151688, L151687,m314
 Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.," Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.", L151371, L151370,m314
 How the hell is that your business?, We're just trying to figure out what happened., L151381, L151380,m314
 You want her sheets?, We can just take this pillowcase., L151386, L151385,m314
 I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?, Why would you want to be a cop?, L151816, L151815,m314
 See he was cheating from the get go., He's been running money for the Mafia., L151838, L151837,m314
" Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too."," Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?", L151278, L151277,m314
 You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk., You're some catch Lloyd., L151280, L151279,m314
 He was found a few blocks away., Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess., L151368, L151367,m314
" I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.", That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?, L151422, L151421,m314
" Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick."," Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?", L151424, L151423,m314
" No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.", I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation., L151426, L151425,m314
 Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know., I told you she was innocent., L151445, L151444,m314
" Hey, there was a lot of blood.", She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this., L151447, L151446,m314
 Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?, Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse., L151450, L151449,m314
 Madonna's in Penthouse?," Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.", L151452, L151451,m314
 What?, And you think I'm sick?, L151455, L151454,m314
 He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park., And he was missing an arm., L151697, L151696,m314
 I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase., We only live a few blocks apart., L151720, L151719,m314
" This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead."," Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.", L151722, L151721,m314
 She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.," She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.", L151724, L151723,m314
 Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.," You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.", L151726, L151725,m314
" Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.", The park dude was missing an arm., L151793, L151792,m314
" Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes."," Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.", L151795, L151794,m314
 Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive..., She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was., L151797, L151796,m314
 He means the last that we know of., This one walk you home too?, L151828, L151827,m314
 Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead., One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed., L151842, L151841,m314
 Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings., It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense., L151858, L151857,m314
 It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes., Like a vampire or some shit?, L151860, L151859,m314

 It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.," Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her.

" General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.", We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>., L204874, L204873,m346
 If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...," They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.", L204876, L204875,m346
 I assume Benes knows how to control it.," That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.", L204878, L204877,m346
 They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation., And take a little trip with them..., L204880, L204879,m346
 Trip? Where to?," Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --", L204882, L204881,m346
 You mean <I'm> going along?, As part of the Crew., L204884, L204883,m346
 Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!," Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.", L204886, L204885,m346
 But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !, It's only for an hour --, L204888, L204887,m346

" Just one, General...", Yes?, L204933, L204932,m346
" Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.", Can't remember?... What do you mean?, L205478, L205477,m346
" Yes, we'd like to get moving.", Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes., L205487, L205486,m346
" Yes, Alan."," Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.", L204846, L204845,m346
 [LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF], I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --, L204855, L204854,m346
 Difficult? He's impossible!, That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty., L204857, L204856,m346
 I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.," And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?", L204862, L204861,m346
 Listen...the Heart., Yes...slowed down agreat deal., L205115, L205114,m346
 I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --, It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool., L205189, L205188,m346
 But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?, We'll know -- in the next breath..., L205219, L205218,m346
 That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on., We must!, L205227, L205226,m346
 You're going out there? With those Antibodies --," No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.", L205298, L205297,m346
 Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?," Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.", L205305, L205304,m346
 Doctor...," Yes, Cora.", L204999, L204998,m346
 What is it?  Anything wrong?, I just wanted to thank you for taking me along., L205002, L205001,m346
 Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope., They're much smaller than bacteria..., L205046, L205045,m346
" Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.", But big enough for us..., L205068, L205067,m346
" Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --", Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice., L205080, L205079,m346
 Air bubbles!... Doctor --," No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.", L205161, L205160,m346
" Cora, is something wrong with the laser?"," I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.", L205186, L205185,m346
 He's making a fine recovery., He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time., L205475, L205474,m346
 Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?, We're pushing oxygen today., L204978, L204977,m346
" I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.", You sound as if you're not looking forward to it., L204980, L204979,m346
" Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.", I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --, L204982, L204981,m346
 That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk..., You may learn to like it., L204984, L204983,m346
 That'll teach you where to keep your hand., Now I know..., L204988, L204987,m346
" That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.", Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter., L204990, L204989,m346
 I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.," I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.", L204992, L204991,m346
" A long time, with one man.", Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --, L204994, L204993,m346
 I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this., I always thought it was nothing but red., L205040, L205039,m346
 -- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock., And if it should take more time to get through --, L205106, L205105,m346
 Look at that...they're changing color..., Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?, L205145, L205144,m346
 Looks like you didn't batten it down too well., But I did. I'm positive!, L205182, L205181,m346
 Then how come it worked loose?, I have no idea., L205184, L205183,m346
 Shouldn't you answer that?," Not now. We need air, not greetings!", L205200, L205199,m346
" I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.", You can't --it's too dangerous --, L205207, L205206,m346
 You must carry spare parts --, Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --, L205225, L205224,m346
" If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?"," No, it requires such absolute precision --", L205232, L205231,m346
 A surgeon might...," Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.", L205234, L205233,m346
 Open it! Open it before they get here!, I can't till the hatch is flooded!, L205323, L205322,m346
 No need to get up --, I feel much better now..., L205341, L205340,m346
 Thank you for saving my life., That's what they pay me for., L205344, L205343,m346
 Such as?, Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval..., L205347, L205346,m346
 That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.," As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?", L205350, L205349,m346
" You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him."," Under a cloud without cause, I take it.", L205352, L205351,m346
" Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.", Depends on which end of the telescope you look through., L205354, L205353,m346
 What do you mean?," Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.", L205356, L205355,m346
 We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.," Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:", L205425, L205424,m346
" Doctor, what's wrong?", I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!, L205021, L205020,m346
 Looks like the molecular structure of proteins., I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample., L205048, L205047,m346
 But that isn't possible., Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!, L205058, L205057,m346
 We can't take a second more., Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it., L205108, L205107,m346
 Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution., You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --, L205153, L205152,m346
 What can we do?, Nothing -- against all that force., L205217, L205216,m346
 That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity., Yes..., L205338, L205337,m346
 It's against my better Judgment..., Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?, L205362, L205361,m346
 I've done all I could with the laser., All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!, L205364, L205363,m346
" If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.", Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser., L205366, L205365,m346
" I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!"," As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.", L205368, L205367,m346
 The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.," Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --", L205379, L205378,m346
 --and certain chemicals involving proteins --, You left something out., L205382, L205381,m346
 What's that?, The Breath of God..., L205384, L205383,m346
 Removal Point? What're you talking about!," We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.", L205390, L205389,m346
" Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!", I'm going to do what I can to save Benes., L205404, L205403,m346
" The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.", You mean Inner Space is endless?, L205037, L205036,m346
 Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life..., Quite a piece of plumbing., L205042, L205041,m346
 I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway..., They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs., L205139, L205138,m346
 Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?," A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.", L205148, L205147,m346
 Don't tell me they're refueling..., Oxygenation..., L205150, L205149,m346
 Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.," Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?", L205172, L205171,m346
 Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?," No, there's no other way.", L205230, L205229,m346
" We'll never get there in time, at this rate.", Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?, L205282, L205281,m346
" Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.", Then why not take it?, L205284, L205283,m346
" ""Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- """," ""Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man...""", L205376, L205375,m346

" Doctor, we've just about had it."," It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...", L205420, L205419,m346
 The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?, We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye., L205436, L205435,m346
 You said there was a quick way out!, What about Dr. Michaels?, L205455, L205454,m346
" We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.", At an operation?, L204851, L204850,m346
" They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.", Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --, L204853, L204852,m346
" Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant."," How are you, Miss Peterson?", L204902, L204901,m346
 About forty miles an hour.," Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.", L204920, L204919,m346
 A what?, A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt., L205066, L205065,m346
" If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?"," Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.", L205074, L205073,m346
 That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back., I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission., L205078, L205077,m346
 Tell them to take us out., If there's any chance --, L205082, L205081,m346
 Sounds like heavy artillery..., It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats., L205117, L205116,m346
 There it is!, Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again., L205126, L205125,m346
" At this size, I would certainly think so."," If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?", L205176, L205175,m346
 In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --," Well, we better get on with it.", L205204, L205203,m346
" Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --", There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub., L205209, L205208,m346
 All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside., Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales., L205212, L205211,m346
 Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?, Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes., L205237, L205236,m346
 But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.," They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.", L205239, L205238,m346
" Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?", Send the following message..., L205241, L205240,m346
" Looks like the sea, at dawn."," We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.", L205249, L205248,m346
 Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --, His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area., L205251, L205250,m346
 Sabotage? I don't understand..., I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?, L205254, L205253,m346
 You have no right to blame Duval --, That line was tampered with..., L205256, L205255,m346
" I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.", You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind..., L205258, L205257,m346
 I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident., Two in a row?, L205260, L205259,m346
" We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.", I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory., L205266, L205265,m346
" Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.", Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon., L205271, L205270,m346
 Looks like somebody declared war.," Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.", L205277, L205276,m346
" They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution."," Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.", L205287, L205286,m346
 Looks like quite a way to go...," No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.", L205334, L205333,m346
" Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?"," Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.", L205392, L205391,m346
" I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!"," Sorry, but the situation has changed.", L205401, L205400,m346
 I don't believe that., Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!, L205407, L205406,m346
" Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.", I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?, L204813, L204812,m346
 I can't tell you., Where we going?, L204815, L204814,m346
 May I?, Go ahead., L204818, L204817,m346

" Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?", Sort of., L204905, L204904,m346
 Atomic fuel?, Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside., L204959, L204958,m346
" If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?", They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it., L204961, L204960,m346
 That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.," It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.", L204963, L204962,m346

 What happened?, Dr. Michaels... He went berserk..., L205445, L205444,m346
 Come on -- it's no use!, We can get out through the Lab Section., L205452, L205451,m346
" Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?", Uh -- what?, L205495, L205494,m346
" We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!"," Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!", L205497, L205496,m346

" What's wrong, Skipper?", What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --, L205293, L205292,m346

 That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?, No.  What am I to do?, L281580, L281579,m388
 Well?, It's done., L281602, L281601,m388

 I stood up first., That doesn't matter., L281618, L281617,m388
 You can go first., No -- after you., L281626, L281625,m388
 It will be a good harvest this year., Can you really tell from doing that?, L281229, L281228,m388
 What do you think?, I think you just like to eat dirt., L281231, L281230,m388

 This cannot be.," It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.", L281247, L281246,m388
 Agreed., I would like to say goodbye., L281249, L281248,m388
 How comes it your are not afraid?, Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?, L281176, L281175,m388
 I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing., And what would'st I gain from this bargain?, L281178, L281177,m388
 Your life., How?, L281180, L281179,m388
 We had a bargain.  You promised., I lied., L281188, L281187,m388
 Aye?, Where do you go when your mind drifts?, L281565, L281564,m388
 Different places., The past?, L281567, L281566,m388
 Sometimes., Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there., L281569, L281568,m388
 I cannot stay., Why not?, L281586, L281585,m388
 Leaving?  For how long?, You'll no see me again., L281589, L281588,m388
 Why?, I cannot explain., L281591, L281590,m388

 To talk to you.," I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.", L281531, L281530,m388
 Corpses?, Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland., L281534, L281533,m388
 Yes.  How did you know?, A lucky guess., L281537, L281536,m388
" I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?", He was wearing a bullet proof vest., L281539, L281538,m388
 Bullet proof vests don't bleed., You got me., L281541, L281540,m388
 Why do I feel that you know what's going on?," Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?", L281543, L281542,m388
 If it's good advice., This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this., L281545, L281544,m388
 Where did you get it?," It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.", L281549, L281548,m388
 You're hurt., I'll be fine., L281648, L281647,m388
 What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?, Because it's my name., L281650, L281649,m388
 Then who's Russell Nash?, I don't know anymore., L281652, L281651,m388
" You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.", Jennifer., L281684, L281683,m388
 Why do you stare at me like that?, You remind me of someone I used to know., L281686, L281685,m388
 I don't have any answers for you., Who was that man last night?, L281689, L281688,m388

 Do you always walk around with a sword?, New York is dangerous place., L281693, L281692,m388
 You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe., About what?, L281695, L281694,m388
 It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book., I'm interested in mythology., L281697, L281696,m388
 No., You look like you have., L281700, L281699,m388
 Yes., Meet me Tratino's at nine., L281703, L281702,m388
 Why?, I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more., L281705, L281704,m388
 Good evening., You're twenty minutes late., L281720, L281719,m388
 You didn't answer my question., I know., L281726, L281725,m388
 You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?, Why?, L281728, L281727,m388
 I'm just trying to place you., I've lived all over the world., L281730, L281729,m388
 You're not an easy person to get to know., Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?, L281732, L281731,m388
 How come you wanted to meet tonight?, I wanted to get to know you better., L281734, L281733,m388
 That makes you uncomfortable?, A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession., L281736, L281735,m388
 Is it?, Yes -- it is., L281738, L281737,m388
 Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--, --the Calan.  Do you know who they are?, L281740, L281739,m388
 Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?, No., L281749, L281748,m388
 Why not?, Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours., L281751, L281750,m388
" Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.", So?, L281754, L281753,m388
 Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them., If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall., L281756, L281755,m388
 That would mean they'd been trapped in there--, --for three hundred years., L281759, L281758,m388
 How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years., Not unless they're immortal., L281761, L281760,m388
 Would you like to see it?, I've seen it., L281767, L281766,m388

 He's in there!, Get out., L281800, L281799,m388
" Be careful, Conner.", Conner?, L281802, L281801,m388
 What now?, Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another., L281821, L281820,m388
 Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt., Where is the film crew from the British Museum?, L281279, L281278,m388
 They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark., Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented., L281281, L281280,m388
 We're holding the workers down below., Why?, L281314, L281313,m388
 Someone broke into the cavern last night., What?  How?, L281316, L281315,m388
 He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside., How could they get by him?, L281319, L281318,m388
 We found him this morning., What's that next to him?, L281322, L281321,m388
 Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication., I don't think it is a duplication., L281326, L281325,m388
 It has to be., And this?, L281328, L281327,m388
 You stayed here again last night?, I was working on the cataloging., L281387, L281386,m388
" Jennifer, there is more to life than work."," I know, Paul.", L281389, L281388,m388
 Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?, I like my work., L281391, L281390,m388
 I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come., We'll see., L281393, L281392,m388
" It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?", It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?, L281195, L281194,m388
 Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?, I do not know -- and even if I did..., L281197, L281196,m388
 Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head., It does not come off as easily as the young ones., L281201, L281200,m388
 Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you., This cannot be., L281634, L281633,m388
" I am stronger than you, Highlander.", That's what the Kurgan said., L281636, L281635,m388
 Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer., Why did you wait?, L281640, L281639,m388
" It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.", It will not end tonight., L281642, L281641,m388
 You know it's not safe here for you., I know., L281214, L281213,m388
 The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash., I can take care of myself., L281216, L281215,m388
" It isn't over, is it, Conner?", No., L281221, L281220,m388
 How can that be?, I don't know., L281223, L281222,m388

 You kept it?, Yes., L281333, L281332,m388
 What are you doing?, I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake., L281412, L281411,m388
 Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?, Yes -- when their troubles can harm them., L281414, L281413,m388
 I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?, Fine., L281552, L281551,m388
 What will you do?, There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon., L281554, L281553,m388

 I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--," You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.", L281656, L281655,m388
 Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there., My dreams died long ago., L281659, L281658,m388

 Absolutely not., They're here., L328866, L328865,m409
" Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.", No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!, L328897, L328896,m409

" When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.", A well-accepted theory., L328836, L328835,m409
" Eric, your parents are both here.", In Costa Rica?, L329104, L329103,m409

 Did you read Malcolm's book?, Yeah., L329119, L329118,m409

Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.

I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.", L330180, L330179,m410
 What?, Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?, L330182, L330181,m410
 What are you talking about?," The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.

 -- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter., Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?, L332992, L332991,m413
 You work in the insurance department?, You have been hearing the sordid side then., L333001, L333000,m413
 Where do you live?, Up there., L333028, L333027,m413
 It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is., What is it really?, L333031, L333030,m413
 A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.," Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.", L333033, L333032,m413
" My assistants, I presume.", Yes -- that's us., L333118, L333117,m413
 You look like brothers., Yes -- we do., L333123, L333122,m413
 Have you worked here long?," No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.", L333125, L333124,m413
 Fine -- terrible., What was the matter with it?, L333215, L333214,m413
 Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?, You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society., L333167, L333166,m413
 Preliminary investigations may already be underway., You were his friend.  One link is all they need., L333183, L333182,m413
 -- Merely in the interests of order., The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support., L333201, L333200,m413
" -- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?", -- Small., L333302, L333301,m413
 Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake., Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced., L333305, L333304,m413
 I've read your stories.  They're fantastic., I don't know what you could have read., L333039, L333038,m413
 Just what you've published., -- In magazines nobody reads., L333041, L333040,m413
 I read the one about the penal colony., Did you?, L333043, L333042,m413
 Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide., -- In what sense?, L333287, L333286,m413

 I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point., What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?, L333423, L333422,m413
 The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?, In a manner of speaking., L333425, L333424,m413
 I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this., An empty tomb?, L333427, L333426,m413
 The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck., Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know., L333430, L333429,m413
 -- You appreciate my writing., Yes., L333432, L333431,m413
 Will you do me a favor then?, Another one?, L333434, L333433,m413
 If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please., What an extraordinary request!, L333436, L333435,m413
 It's my last and final one., Then its authority is in doubt., L333438, L333437,m413
 A true friend would do it., Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would., L333440, L333439,m413
 The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim., I gave it to him yesterday., L332946, L332945,m413
 You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.," No, I left it in his office.", L332948, L332947,m413
 Did you see him?, I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files., L332950, L332949,m413
 He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.," He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?", L332952, L332951,m413
" In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all."," Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --", L332955, L332954,m413

" When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.", I'll commit that to memory., L332959, L332958,m413
 Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?, Yes., L333233, L333232,m413
 Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?, Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention., L333109, L333108,m413
" Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own."," Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.", L333111, L333110,m413
" It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.", You're just doing your job., L333113, L333112,m413
 It's what I'm paid to do., You're detestable., L333115, L333114,m413
" You wanted to see me, sir."," Sit down, Kafka.", L333086, L333085,m413
" You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.", ... My ... social situation?, L333088, L333087,m413
" To do my work well, I have little time for --", You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?, L333091, L333090,m413
 I usually take lunch by the River.," It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.", L333093, L333092,m413
 I did not realize it was obligatory.," Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?", L333095, L333094,m413
" No, sir."," Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.", L333097, L333096,m413
" Well, I --"," Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?", L333099, L333098,m413
 -- Eduard --," -- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.", L333101, L333100,m413
 I understand you fancy yourself an author., In a small way., L333106, L333105,m413
" Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.", I do., L333337, L333336,m413
 Was there something else?, No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs., L333341, L333340,m413
" No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.", I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then., L333343, L333342,m413

 I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --, I know., L332974, L332973,m413
 You're a friend of Eduard Raban's., Why would you suppose so?, L332976, L332975,m413
" Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --", One of you must be mistaken., L332978, L332977,m413
" I'm sorry, but I just wondered --"," Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.", L332980, L332979,m413

 Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office., Yes., L333023, L333022,m413
 I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?, No., L333130, L333129,m413
 He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me., I suspected that he -- well., L333132, L333131,m413
 What?, That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry., L333134, L333133,m413
 What's funny?, This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving., L333137, L333136,m413
 How long were you and Eduard --," Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.", L333140, L333139,m413
" No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.", Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing., L333143, L333142,m413
" The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?", Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto., L333145, L333144,m413
 He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet., And you believe everything the authorities tell you., L333147, L333146,m413
 When I have no reason to doubt., The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police., L333149, L333148,m413
 Are you free tonight?, Tonight?, L333152, L333151,m413
 There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?, ... All right., L333154, L333153,m413
" You almost married recently, didn't you?", Last year.  I -- it was broken off., L333156, L333155,m413
 Eduard wanted to marry me., And you ...?, L333158, L333157,m413
 -- I don't know the Musil district., You won't have any trouble finding it., L333161, L333160,m413
" Ah -- we're back to the ""authorities"" you spoke of.", They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so., L333169, L333168,m413
 I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work., I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from., L333176, L333175,m413
" The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?", What of it?, L333185, L333184,m413
 And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered., He was murdered., L333190, L333189,m413
 You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.," I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.", L333195, L333194,m413
" When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression."," People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.", L333197, L333196,m413
 You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?, My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?, L333207, L333206,m413
" Yes -- which is why ""quiet, dependable people"" have to take charge of their own lives.", At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there., L333209, L333208,m413
" I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.", Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?, L333235, L333234,m413
 Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him., Why were you given notice?, L333237, L333236,m413
 They're not obliged to tell., It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day., L333239, L333238,m413
 Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard., You don't believe that., L333241, L333240,m413
 You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character., Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him., L333246, L333245,m413
 That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River., Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad., L333249, L333248,m413
 Burgel doesn't like anybody!, He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him., L333251, L333250,m413
" Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.", Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?, L333254, L333253,m413
 How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?, I've heard of it happening., L333256, L333255,m413
" And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?", Usually., L333258, L333257,m413
 Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.," First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.", L333260, L333259,m413
 What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that., Now Burgel's one of the authorities?, L333262, L333261,m413
 Gabriela! -- you did get away., I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did., L333497, L333496,m413
 -- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over., Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit., L333499, L333498,m413
 Gabriela ...?, Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure., L333501, L333500,m413
 Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that., I -- I found your jailer., L333504, L333503,m413
 This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment., They're dead now.  We can get help., L333506, L333505,m413
 I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others., There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected., L333508, L333507,m413
 I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.," I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.", L333510, L333509,m413
 I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment., No -- not this time., L333513, L333512,m413
 I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day., -- Listen to me --, L333515, L333514,m413
 Kafka -- is that your real name?," Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?", L333053, L333052,m413
 When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?, Wednesday.  We left the office together., L333055, L333054,m413
 Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?," No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.", L333057, L333056,m413
 Your office is the Workmen's --, -- Accident and Compensation Association., L333059, L333058,m413
 Where you've been employed for seven years., Eight -- and seven months., L333061, L333060,m413
 Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.," Well -- other departments are, yes.", L333063, L333062,m413
 Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?," Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...", L333065, L333064,m413
 He was found in the River.  Could he swim?, I don't know., L333067, L333066,m413
 Was he depressed?, No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?, L333069, L333068,m413
" Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?"," No, I suppose not.", L333071, L333070,m413
" He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.", Can I ask -- how you found me?, L333073, L333072,m413
 His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to., I don't think he really had any. He had no family either., L333075, L333074,m413
" He wasn't a lonely man, though.", What makes you think so?, L333078, L333077,m413
 Probably not.," Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.", L333082, L333081,m413
 I'll bear that in mind., -- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant., L333084, L333083,m413
" But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.", That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction., L333271, L333270,m413
 You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard., That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add., L333275, L333274,m413
 Maybe it's true then what she said., What did she say?, L333279, L333278,m413
 Do you?, We saw her naked once -- didn't we., L333220, L333219,m413
 I didn't realize you'd been here that long., You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are., L333224, L333223,m413
 -- I was just trying to finish some work!, You mean you've actually begun some?, L333373, L333372,m413
 What's the matter with you?, I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it, L333379, L333378,m413
 For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors., -- Just doing our job., L333400, L333399,m413
" Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.", Close only by virtue of antithesis., L333405, L333404,m413
 My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything., It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects., L333407, L333406,m413
 ... Why take me into your confidence?," That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.", L333174, L333173,m413
 That's <u>mad</u>.," -- Oh, yes, it's mad.", L333309, L333308,m413
" -- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix."," When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...", L333311, L333310,m413
 Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty., Then why haven't I been --, L333315, L333314,m413
" -- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel."," Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!", L333319, L333318,m413

 -- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.," ""Accident and Compensation"" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.", L333470, L333469,m413

 And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.," Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.", L333475, L333474,m413
 May I ask where your two warders are?, Lying in the gutter where they belong., L333478, L333477,m413
 The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.," On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.", L333482, L333481,m413
" -- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.", What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?, L333486, L333485,m413

" I'm overworked as it is.  ""Raban"" did you say?", Yes.  Isn't it there?, L333328, L333327,m413
" Wait a minute.  ""Raban?""  Where have I heard that name?", He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department, L333330, L333329,m413
 What's the matter?, Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?, L333332, L333331,m413
 It's gone out so quickly?," Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.", L333334, L333333,m413
 If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?, Orlac is an account?, L333351, L333350,m413
 All these in the last year?," You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!", L333356, L333355,m413
 I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal., Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss., L333358, L333357,m413
 This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?, Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it., L333360, L333359,m413
" Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?", Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?, L333362, L333361,m413
 What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?, These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?, L333364, L333363,m413
 What if I petitioned one of the Directors?," You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.", L333366, L333365,m413
 Where do our records go to in the Castle?," We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.", L333368, L333367,m413

 It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous., And we're upset too., L333377, L333376,m413
 We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa., -- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?, L333382, L333381,m413
 But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult., My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip., L333411, L333410,m413

 Was there such a thing?, Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia., L347585, L347584,m421

" What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?"," Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.", L410710, L410709,m457

Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.", Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him., L410555, L410554,m457
 It's possible. The guy was a blank slate., So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense., L410557, L410556,m457
 Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs., No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful., L410559, L410558,m457

 And we really do have to talk., You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed., L410441, L410440,m457
 I had to limit your options., And Linda..., L410443, L410442,m457

 Who are you?, So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --, L443578, L443577,m473
 She comes along too., Zira doesn't want your female., L443582, L443581,m473
 I want her., If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --, L443584, L443583,m473
 Shouldn't we be moving on?, I'm for that., L443653, L443652,m473
 Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?, In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair., L443659, L443658,m473
" Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.", Always giving orders. Just like every other adult., L443693, L443692,m473
" Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?", Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --, L443734, L443733,m473

 I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.," Yes, I can do that.", L443738, L443737,m473
 They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?, I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose., L443762, L443761,m473
 Lucius., I think you're making a mistake., L443780, L443779,m473
 That's the boy. Keep 'em flying., What?, L443782, L443781,m473
 I told you not to bring the other one., He wouldn't leave her., L443587, L443586,m473

" Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.", Why special?, L443382, L443381,m473
 You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here., My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation., L443444, L443443,m473

 Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down., My name is Taylor., L443459, L443458,m473
 It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself., This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story..., L443461, L443460,m473
 One is in a museum!, Dr. Zira! Silence that man!, L443494, L443493,m473

You may proceed, Dr. Honorius."," By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.", L443442, L443441,m473
" Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.", Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something., L443454, L443453,m473
 That╒s a lie!," Mind your tongue, madame.", L443470, L443469,m473
" Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.", Read it yourself., L443481, L443480,m473

 This is a joke in very poor taste., Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?, L443485, L443484,m473
 How so?," Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.", L443526, L443525,m473
 Sustained.," Sustain all objections, but face the truth!", L443532, L443531,m473
 Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?, With one of them., L443504, L443503,m473
 What about me?," Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?", L443543, L443542,m473
 No.," Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.", L443545, L443544,m473
" However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.", I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours., L443547, L443546,m473
 You lied. Where is your tribe?," My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.", L443549, L443548,m473
" Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?", What about it?, L443551, L443550,m473
" A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?", I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira., L443553, L443552,m473
 Certainly not.," That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.", L443555, L443554,m473
 Of course.," All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?", L443557, L443556,m473
 Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --, Then you admit --, L443559, L443558,m473
" I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?"," Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?", L443561, L443560,m473
" You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?", I don't know., L443563, L443562,m473
" If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.", I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?, L443565, L443564,m473
 Stop right there., Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned., L443667, L443666,m473
 There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.," All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.", L443683, L443682,m473
 What is your proposal?, When were the Sacred Scrolls written?, L443687, L443686,m473
 Twelve hundred years ago., Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history, L443689, L443688,m473
 Of course., Okay.Up to the cave., L443691, L443690,m473
" I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you."," That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.", L443723, L443722,m473
 Tell him to pull back!, Cease fire! Withdraw!, L443729, L443728,m473
" Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?"," He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.", L443753, L443752,m473
 Then there is another jungle?," Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.", L443766, L443765,m473
 Sure.," Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?", L443768, L443767,m473
" Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?"," Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.", L443786, L443785,m473
 What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.," The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.", L443788, L443787,m473
 We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.," Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.", L443790, L443789,m473
" Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?"," Listen, listen -- I can speak --", L443259, L443258,m473

 Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?, Shhhh!, L443434, L443433,m473
 What is this?, A hearing., L443436, L443435,m473
 It's him...Landon., Which one?, L443501, L443500,m473
 You! ... You knew about this?," No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.", L443509, L443508,m473
 Listen-, Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes., L443590, L443589,m473
" Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.", You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?, L443619, L443618,m473
 Are you going to take her with you?, Yes., L443633, L443632,m473
" Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.", Maybe not., L443635, L443634,m473
 You want her that much?," You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.", L443637, L443636,m473
" What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?", She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant., L443655, L443654,m473
 And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.," Taylor, please --", L443680, L443679,m473
 Taylor! Tell him., He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls., L443710, L443709,m473
 Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.," Taylor, you can't.", L443742, L443741,m473
" Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.", Why not?, L443747, L443746,m473
 It's humiliating., Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?, L443749, L443748,m473
 Would you like to come along?, We can't., L443771, L443770,m473
" Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye."," All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!", L443776, L443775,m473
" Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.", God bless you., L443778, L443777,m473
 He's moving his fingers!, Of course. He saw you moving yours., L443287, L443286,m473
 Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?," Yes, Sir.", L443385, L443384,m473
 Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.," I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.", L443487, L443486,m473
 Do you believe him?," Like you, I find it difficult.", L443489, L443488,m473
 But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture., This is his assertion., L443491, L443490,m473
" How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?", He doesn't know., L443496, L443495,m473
" Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.", Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity., L443524, L443523,m473
" Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?"," But there's the doll, sir.", L443705, L443704,m473
 But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?," He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.", L443764, L443763,m473
 But the proof? The doll?, In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry., L443799, L443798,m473
" Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.", What do you mean?, L450131, L450130,m478
" Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.", I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush., L450148, L450147,m478

 Why us?," Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.", L450182, L450181,m478
 What story did you give to Davis?," We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men.

 You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.," You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader.

 I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.," Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training.

You would have been prepared.", L466806, L466805,m489
" To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father.

 The other he spoke of is your twin sister., But I have no sister., L466813, L466812,m489
" Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.", Leia! Leia's my sister., L466815, L466814,m489
" But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her."," She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family.

ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a ""platform"" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a ""platform"" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?"," Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean ""AQ""...""aggressive qualities""?", L519213, L519212,m521
" Oh my God, what is he doing?", He's shutting off the air!!!, L525716, L525715,m526
 Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!, I'll tell you what I'm going to do., L525756, L525755,m526
 Getting drunk is no solution.," Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.", L525778, L525777,m526
 I think we're moving., Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about., L525818, L525817,m526
 I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.," Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.", L525820, L525819,m526
" Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...", Oh yeah..., L525874, L525873,m526
 Oh yeah..., Oh Sara..., L525876, L525875,m526
 Anna..., Anna..., L525878, L525877,m526
" Jesus, come on!", They're not going to make it!, L525956, L525955,m526
 Evening., It can't be., L525350, L525349,m526
 Excuse me?, You're Warren Wayne., L525352, L525351,m526
" Uh, yes I am.  And you are?"," Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -", L525354, L525353,m526
" Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?"," My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.", L525356, L525355,m526
" Oh, thank you."," Magnificent, magnificent.", L525358, L525357,m526
 Well I appreciate that.," So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?", L525360, L525359,m526
" Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance."," Of course, of course...", L525362, L525361,m526
 So..., Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip., L525364, L525363,m526
" Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?", It certainly is., L525366, L525365,m526
" Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.", I'm sure I will., L525368, L525367,m526
" No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.", Very professional of you., L525435, L525434,m526
 Where the hell did you come from?, Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge., L525671, L525670,m526
 Weren't you down in the dining room?, I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly., L525680, L525679,m526
 Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -," You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?", L525683, L525682,m526
" And what are they doing now, Mac?", They are awaiting further information., L525686, L525685,m526
 Were you going to give it to them?, I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this., L525688, L525687,m526
 On channel 10?, The device has stopped responding., L525692, L525691,m526
" Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.", My...wings..., L525708, L525707,m526
 I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this., I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one., L525711, L525710,m526
 There is a high level...of passenger , And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac..., L525713, L525712,m526
" Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery."," Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.", L525337, L525336,m526
 What did you say to me?, It's a little late for you to be up., L525478, L525477,m526
" All too well, captain.", Well shut it off at once!, L525485, L525484,m526
" Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.", Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much., L525342, L525341,m526
" No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?", Well it's a good thing that I did., L525377, L525376,m526
 It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?, There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?, L525379, L525378,m526
 Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands., Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok., L525381, L525380,m526
 You're certain of that?, Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes., L525383, L525382,m526
" Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.", Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -, L525445, L525444,m526
" So, are you on for the next one?"," I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.", L525447, L525446,m526
" Why, didn't they say?"," Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.", L525449, L525448,m526
 You want to go back to shuttle work?," It's steady, good benefits.", L525451, L525450,m526
 You gotta think of your old age.," That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.", L525453, L525452,m526
" Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?."," Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?", L525456, L525455,m526
" What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?", Uh..., L525458, L525457,m526
 I think I can handle it.," Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?", L525460, L525459,m526
 No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.," Well, maybe I'll surprise you.", L525462, L525461,m526
 Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!," Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.", L525495, L525494,m526
 If anyone can hear me please respond!," That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.", L525498, L525497,m526
" Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?"," Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.", L525501, L525500,m526
" The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?"," Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!", L525504, L525503,m526
" Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.", What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -, L525506, L525505,m526
 Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?, You better start making sense!, L525512, L525511,m526
" Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.", Then we've got to get to the lifepods!, L525514, L525513,m526
 It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!," Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?", L525532, L525531,m526
" Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.", We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?, L525604, L525603,m526
" That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.", Will you transmit the distress signal?, L525607, L525606,m526
" Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?"," Taylor, you surprise me.", L525695, L525694,m526
 I don't know what you're talking about!, Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?, L525698, L525697,m526
 Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!," I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?", L525700, L525699,m526
 Idiot..., Good help is hard to find..., L525897, L525896,m526
 Barnes?, That's me., L525585, L525584,m526
" Break it down to me, what's going on?", Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon., L525587, L525586,m526
 Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.," Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.", L525589, L525588,m526
 Will do.  What about the distress signal?, I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave., L525591, L525590,m526
 Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.," Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.", L525593, L525592,m526
 It's time we lock coordinates.," I know, I know.", L525806, L525805,m526
" So, what are we waiting for?", Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control., L525808, L525807,m526
" You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?"," The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!", L525859, L525858,m526
 This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!," Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!", L525861, L525860,m526
 Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?," I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!", L525883, L525882,m526
 Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!," Let's get something straight, Chappy!", L525885, L525884,m526
 Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.," This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!", L525888, L525887,m526
 Is that clear?, That's clear., L525892, L525891,m526
 Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me., Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!, L525894, L525893,m526
 Look at this...Jesus.," Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.", L525404, L525403,m526
 No.  But it buys a lot of other things., Like that piece of ass he was with., L525406, L525405,m526
" Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.", Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off., L525408, L525407,m526
" Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here."," I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.", L525410, L525409,m526
 What's the use...we're gonna die..., Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!, L525726, L525725,m526
 We're going to die., Will you shut up already?, L525748, L525747,m526
 It's getting hard to breathe..., Just don't move around too much., L525864, L525863,m526
" Oh right, right you're on that research grant.", That's right., L525388, L525387,m526
" Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?"," Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?", L525390, L525389,m526
 So you were looking for a new challenge.," Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?", L525393, L525392,m526
" Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.", Like open an airlock by mistake?, L525395, L525394,m526
 Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher., Well I hope I don't do anything careless., L525397, L525396,m526
 I'm sure you'll be all right.," Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.", L525399, L525398,m526
 Really?," Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.", L525401, L525400,m526
 What are we going to do?, I don't know., L525538, L525537,m526
 We don't., Well maybe there's a way out of here., L525542, L525541,m526
" Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?", Probably come through the wall I suppose., L525545, L525544,m526
" I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?", Just considering our options... sir., L525548, L525547,m526
 Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?, It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry., L525577, L525576,m526
 Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?, With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me., L525579, L525578,m526
 OK...it's open., Seen one like it before?, L525611, L525610,m526
 Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes., Great., L525613, L525612,m526
 Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -, Why can't we?, L525644, L525643,m526
 And suppose you couldn't hold out?, Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?, L525648, L525647,m526
" We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.", You're right., L525650, L525649,m526
 He certainly is polite., Close every door behind you!, L525656, L525655,m526
 It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.," Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.", L525662, L525661,m526
 If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.," Even if we do, it might be too late.", L525731, L525730,m526
 Everyone just stay put., Wait., L525736, L525735,m526
 I can't let you do that., Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking., L525739, L525738,m526
 I don't know what we're facing., I understand., L525761, L525760,m526
 Are you ready?, Ready as I'll ever be., L525763, L525762,m526
 Yeah.  We did it., So we did., L525767, L525766,m526
 You're ready for the real thing?, At this point I'm ready for anything., L525770, L525769,m526
" Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.", Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?, L525786, L525785,m526
 Explosive?," One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...", L525790, L525789,m526
 Taylor?, Yeah?, L525794, L525793,m526
" Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature."," Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.", L525797, L525796,m526
 Do you want some advice?, Sure., L525799, L525798,m526
" Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.", Words to live by., L525801, L525800,m526
 Dawn!  Dawn!, Helllp!, L525815, L525814,m526
 I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.," It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.", L525826, L525825,m526
 Oh my God.  What happened?, The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown., L525828, L525827,m526
 What's that?, A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods., L525831, L525830,m526
 We don't have enough suits to get the others out.," That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.", L525833, L525832,m526
 Take this flare., A flare?  A flare won't do it., L525837, L525836,m526
" A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?", Why?  Where are you going?, L525842, L525841,m526
 I'm not going with you., What?  What are you talking about?, L525844, L525843,m526
 And what are you going to do?!, I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here., L525847, L525846,m526
 But how are you going to escape?, Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal., L525849, L525848,m526
 But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!, I can't!, L525851, L525850,m526
 I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck., You too., L525857, L525856,m526
 Dawn.  Come in., Taylor!  Where are you?, L525900, L525899,m526
 I'm in the bridge., Barnes?, L525902, L525901,m526
 He's out of the equation.  Talk to me., I'm about to blow the wall., L525904, L525903,m526
 Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!, How does the distress signal look?, L525906, L525905,m526
" Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.", I'll do my best., L525908, L525907,m526
 So what's going to happen to you?, I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry., L525910, L525909,m526
" Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?", Hopefully sooner than later., L525912, L525911,m526
 Sooner than later., Over and out., L525914, L525913,m526
 What the hell are you doing?, We have room!  Let's go!, L525950, L525949,m526
 What do you mean?  What happened!," We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!", L525952, L525951,m526
 So close..., And so far., L525962, L525961,m526
" I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.", It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that., L525975, L525974,m526
 Will you marry me?, Marry you?, L525979, L525978,m526
" I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.", It would matter to us., L525982, L525981,m526
" In that case, I accept."," Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.", L525984, L525983,m526
" Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...", Try not to think about it., L525990, L525989,m526

" No, just enjoying the view."," Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.", L525308, L525307,m526
 So I've been told.," Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.", L525310, L525309,m526
" Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.", That is one of my priorities., L525626, L525625,m526
 What is happening around here!!!, There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!, L525921, L525920,m526
 Where's Taylor?, He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?, L525923, L525922,m526
 Carlo!, He's in the bathroom., L525927, L525926,m526
 I'm going back for Taylor!, Are you nuts!  It's too risky!, L525943, L525942,m526
 I'm homesick., Homesick?  It's only been two days!, L525324, L525323,m526
" We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach."," Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.", L525326, L525325,m526
 How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?," Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.", L525328, L525327,m526
" Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.", I guess so., L525330, L525329,m526
 Oh no...I think there's carrots in here..., Send it back if you don't want it., L525419, L525418,m526

 This answers one of our questions., Which one?  Let me get the list out., L527078, L527077,m528
" This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home."," But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.", L527080, L527079,m528
 I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?," Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.", L527099, L527098,m528
 And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.," Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.", L527112, L527111,m528
" Don't be so optomistic, Harry.", I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?, L527123, L527122,m528
 Not a clue., A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible., L527125, L527124,m528
 I don't follow you.," On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an ""Unknown Entry Event."" They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.", L527127, L527126,m528
" So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.

" It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you."," Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.", L527141, L527140,m528
 What is that?  That noise?, What noise?, L527229, L527228,m528
" Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?", What are you still doing here?, L527232, L527231,m528
 You remember opening the door?, You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here., L527234, L527233,m528
 Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?, You don't understand about the sphere., L527236, L527235,m528

" You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.", Did I?, L527269, L527268,m528
 You don't remember that?," I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.", L527271, L527270,m528

 You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious., Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?, L527020, L527019,m528

 We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them., Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?, L542175, L542174,m529
" No, not anymore.", I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system., L542177, L542176,m529
" Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.", Who's going to pay me then?, L542181, L542180,m529
 I think there are some things we should talk about., I'm beginning not to like you., L542183, L542182,m529
 How much do you think she's talking about?," A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...", L542185, L542184,m529
" Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault."," This isn't a game, you know.", L542198, L542197,m529
" Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.", Fear is their greatest weapon., L542201, L542200,m529
 You have your father's style.  You've done very well., Not bad., L542206, L542205,m529
 We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?, Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn..., L542219, L542218,m529
 We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.," All right then, we'll use your plan.", L542221, L542220,m529
 I'll get the information., ... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments., L542223, L542222,m529
 Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal., Is that good or bad?, L542250, L542249,m529
 Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.," There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?", L542256, L542255,m529
" That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything."," We'll be back before you are, old man.", L542274, L542273,m529
 Good morning!," What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?", L541995, L541994,m529
" Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.", Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!, L541999, L541998,m529
" I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu."," Oh, so you're a warrior then?", L542008, L542007,m529
 Who are you anyway?, You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi., L542014, L542013,m529
 You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?, I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories., L542016, L542015,m529
 I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met., I am the son of Annikin Starkiller., L542019, L542018,m529
 I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important., But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father..., L542021, L542020,m529
 I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper., I know that., L542023, L542022,m529
 You saw through me?, You could put it that way., L542025, L542024,m529
 I assure you my intentions weren't bad.," I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?", L542027, L542026,m529
 I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing., But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it., L542031, L542030,m529
" I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years."," But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!", L542033, L542032,m529
 You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me., My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was..., L542040, L542039,m529
" Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.", You mean I generate an energy field?, L542042, L542041,m529
 It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!, Could I learn to feel it?, L542044, L542043,m529
" That is not a human decision, not your or mine.", What do you mean?, L542046, L542045,m529
" Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.", But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help., L542050, L542049,m529
" A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.", How can you store an energy field within you?, L542052, L542051,m529
" When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.", Don't you have a Kiber crystal?, L542054, L542053,m529
" I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...", That's where my father was killed., L542056, L542055,m529
 Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful., Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?, L542058, L542057,m529
 They use the Bogan Force.," Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.", L542060, L542059,m529
 We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?," Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.", L542094, L542093,m529
 This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?, He's bluffing..., L542117, L542116,m529
" When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?", I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there., L542136, L542135,m529
 But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?, These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the..., L542138, L542137,m529
 What's wrong?  What's happening?," Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.", L542140, L542139,m529
 Are you all right?," Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.", L542142, L542141,m529
 Are you sure you don't need it?, I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on., L542155, L542154,m529
 What do I do?," All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.", L542157, L542156,m529
 What is it?, He can't find Organa Major., L542165, L542164,m529
 But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases., You mean we should go after her!..., L542191, L542190,m529
 I can't see!  How can I fight?, Try to feel it.  Use the Force..., L542212, L542211,m529
 I can't do it.  I'll get hit.," Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.", L542214, L542213,m529
" See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it."," I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.", L542216, L542215,m529
 What about the princess?, You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal., L542253, L542252,m529
 The Kiber Crystal., Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it., L542433, L542432,m529
" Of course, where you been kid?", You look great!  The uniform and everything!, L541905, L541904,m529
" That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!", But there was a lot of firing earlier..., L541910, L541909,m529
" I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...", But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?, L541930, L541929,m529
" The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.", At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position., L541932, L541931,m529
 You're Starkiller?," Yes, sir.", L542448, L542447,m529
 Have you been checked out?," Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.", L542450, L542449,m529
" Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on."," Yes, sir.", L542452, L542451,m529
" Blue Five, does that glare bother you?", I've got it blocked.  I'm all right., L542464, L542463,m529
" I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.", What's that?, L542491, L542490,m529
" Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?"," Yes, sir, but I can get him...", L542493, L542492,m529
 No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.," Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.", L542226, L542225,m529
 Should we alert the Sith Lords?, I'll make a report later., L542228, L542227,m529
" As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.", Send one squad up., L542230, L542229,m529
 We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it., Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear., L542233, L542232,m529
 Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.," Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!", L542362, L542361,m529
 Here come six more... grid two!, Was this trip really necessary?, L542386, L542385,m529
 There are only three or four left.," Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.", L542389, L542388,m529
 All the data banks in Artoo are still secure., Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through., L542394, L542393,m529
" When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.", What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?, L542396, L542395,m529
" The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo."," We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.", L542398, L542397,m529
 Where are you taking us now anyway?, The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca., L542400, L542399,m529
 I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless., Did it occur to you they might find us?, L542411, L542410,m529
 We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives., I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks., L542413, L542412,m529
" What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it."," I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?", L542421, L542420,m529
 Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand., That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first., L542092, L542091,m529
 You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.," We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.", L542097, L542096,m529
 Who's the pilot?, It's automatic., L542151, L542150,m529
" I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.", You don't believe in the Force?, L542159, L542158,m529
 I found it... It's just not there., What are you saying?, L542167, L542166,m529
 You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them..., Why?, L542179, L542178,m529
 Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.," All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.", L542188, L542187,m529
" No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!", Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try., L542195, L542194,m529
" Well, I practice a lot..."," You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?", L542208, L542207,m529
" Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.", Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around., L542268, L542267,m529
 This isn't going to work., Why didn't you say so before., L542281, L542280,m529
 Something has happened to them. Let's try this way..., Let's try this way!  Holy Maker., L542307, L542306,m529
 I think she's going to be all right., Not if this tunnel deadends., L542314, L542313,m529
 Is he afraid of the water?," No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.", L542320, L542319,m529
 Watch it!  Move back., Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away., L542323, L542322,m529
" It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!", Move out of the way!, L542328, L542327,m529
 Get to the ship!, Come back here... Where are you going?, L542349, L542348,m529
 I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right., They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there., L542407, L542406,m529
 You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...," I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.", L542429, L542428,m529

" No need, everything's under control.", With four casualties?!, L542290, L542289,m529
 The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed., Who is this?  What's your operating..., L542292, L542291,m529
" Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...", You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!, L541921, L541920,m529
 The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now., They'll find its weakness., L542145, L542144,m529
 No!..., It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste..., L542148, L542147,m529
 What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?, You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax., L542317, L542316,m529
 I am Luke Starkiller at your service., There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here., L542333, L542332,m529
 Are there medical facilities on Yavin?, He'll be well cared for., L542405, L542404,m529
 And you?, I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship., L542425, L542424,m529
 First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.," I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.", L541950, L541949,m529
 You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up..., But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!, L541952, L541951,m529
" I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.", You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here..., L541954, L541953,m529
 Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.," I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.", L541961, L541960,m529
 That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.," Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.", L541963, L541962,m529

 You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?," That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...", L541967, L541966,m529
 Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?," Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...", L541969, L541968,m529
" According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost..."," If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.", L541987, L541986,m529
" What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...", Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back., L542003, L542002,m529
" I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for."," No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...", L542005, L542004,m529

 Are you safe?, For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now., L542345, L542344,m529
" Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...", See Threepio!  Do you copy?, L542352, L542351,m529

 Who is...'V'ger'...?, V'ger is that which programmed me., L544948, L544947,m531
 Where is Lt. Ilia?, That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise., L544952, L544951,m531
 Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?, V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator., L544955, L544954,m531
 Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?, To join with him., L544957, L544956,m531
 The Creator is that which created V'ger., Who is V'ger?, L544962, L544961,m531
 The examination is a normal function., You may proceede., L544968, L544967,m531
 <U>Why</U>...?!, The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet., L545120, L545119,m531
 <U>Why</U>?!, The Creator has not answered., L545122, L545121,m531
 The carbon-units are not responsible for that., You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner., L545124, L545123,m531
 Disclose the information., Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet., L545137, L545136,m531
" Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?", Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet., L545150, L545149,m531
 They have repressed the Creator., The information will not be disclosed., L545152, L545151,m531
 Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices., V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information., L545155, L545154,m531
 Our data is being prepared., <U>Answer</U>!, L545226, L545225,m531
 The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?, Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?, L545002, L545001,m531
 Yes., Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement., L545004, L545003,m531
 What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?, Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units., L545006, L545005,m531
 Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units., More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage., L545008, L545007,m531
 What does that mean?," When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.", L545010, L545009,m531
 Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns, That is logical. You may procede., L545012, L545011,m531
 Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?, The carbon units are of no consequence, L545035, L545034,m531
 You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator., That is how V'ger will survive., L545038, L545037,m531
 A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?, By the Creator., L545091, L545090,m531
" To join, and become One with the Creator?", To learn all that is learnable, L545093, L545092,m531
" As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator."," V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...", L545106, L545105,m531
 'To learn all that is learnable.'," It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.", L545108, L545107,m531
 And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?, It will... take me from <U>you</U>..., L545236, L545235,m531
 Departure angle on viewer., Departure angle., L544682, L544681,m531

 Yes., May I ask Why?, L544594, L544593,m531
" My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew..."," Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.", L544596, L544595,m531
" That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will."," No, Admiral. I don't think you are", L544599, L544598,m531
" We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible..."," None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.", L544617, L544616,m531
 Programming ready?," Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...", L544690, L544689,m531
 ... but I still recommend further simulation study., Mister Decker, L544692, L544691,m531
" Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?"," Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.", L544738, L544737,m531
" Then you acted properly, of course."," Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.", L544740, L544739,m531
 You saved the ship.," I'm aware of that, sir.", L544742, L544741,m531
" Stop competing with me, Decker!"," Permission to speak freely, sir?", L544744, L544743,m531
 Granted.," Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.", L544746, L544745,m531
" I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?"," Yes, sir, I'll do that.", L544748, L544747,m531
 If our Executive Officer has no objections...?, Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications., L544773, L544772,m531
" Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields."," No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?", L544815, L544814,m531
" Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?", Mr Decker...., L544819, L544818,m531
" I advise caution, Captain", That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet., L544865, L544864,m531
" That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble."," How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!", L544867, L544866,m531
 <U>Computer off</U>!, It's taken control of the computer...!, L544900, L544899,m531
 The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!," Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!", L544909, L544908,m531
 Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us," They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.", L544923, L544922,m531
" Captain, what's the next move?"," The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...", L545163, L545162,m531
" Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called."," I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.", L545167, L545166,m531
"     , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>"," Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.", L545208, L545207,m531
 Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately., Captain... I'd like to go along..., L545221, L545220,m531
" The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal."," Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...", L545251, L545250,m531
" And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback."," Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!", L545253, L545252,m531
" They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away."," That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.", L544858, L544857,m531
 We could have cut it off at the main computer..., This served the purpose., L544903, L544902,m531

 Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too., It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image., L545126, L545125,m531
" Forward motion, Captain...!", A tractor beam..., L545161, L545160,m531
" Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?"," V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension", L545193, L545192,m531
 That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. ,"    We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.", L545217, L545216,m531

 It was my fault we lost the Power Source., Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it., L555730, L555729,m540

 What's a tree?," It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.", L555676, L555675,m540
 Where is Earth?, Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?, L555678, L555677,m540
 Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space., I don't understand., L555681, L555680,m540
" You see, a tree is a living thing.", Can you create life?, L555685, L555684,m540
 I'm sorry... I didn't know., It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you., L555705, L555704,m540
 I can do that., No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?, L555798, L555797,m540

 My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.," Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.", L555806, L555805,m540
 She did that deliberately., She's a beast., L555810, L555809,m540
 How'd you do that?, Must've been a defective puck., L555812, L555811,m540
 Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you., But what for?, L555814, L555813,m540

 You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?, I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers., L556048, L556047,m540

" Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.", It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me., L555755, L555754,m540
 I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.," You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena.

You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.", L555757, L555756,m540
 I just did. Because I have the Power., You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over., L555759, L555758,m540
" Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.", Cigarette?, L555761, L555760,m540

" Nigel, get lost.", I have to talk to you., L555889, L555888,m540
 You're wasting your breath., You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft., L555891, L555890,m540

 Nothing's wrong with my skin., Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself., L555896, L555895,m540
" You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.", We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft., L556161, L556160,m540
 Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?, You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power., L556173, L556172,m540
" Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?", Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart., L556175, L556174,m540
 That was meant for me!, Thank you. I'm going to close this up again., L555927, L555926,m540
 Who are you ?, I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry., L556126, L556125,m540
 That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while., A cheap trick., L556131, L556130,m540

" You've run out of things to throw, Selena.", Not yet., L556403, L556402,m540
 I'm free. I can never thank you enough., For what?, L556422, L556421,m540
 Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time., Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you., L556424, L556423,m540

 I was on Earth..., Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?, L556271, L556270,m540
 Shouldnt've done that.," ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.", L556274, L556273,m540
 It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---, I know., L556276, L556275,m540
 Others?, Criminals., L556279, L556278,m540
" ...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam...""", What? Palace? Hardly., L556282, L556281,m540

" Are you happy, Zaltar?", What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time., L556288, L556287,m540
 You look at them? How?, The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools., L556292, L556291,m540
 That horrible woman!, Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad., L556303, L556302,m540
" Zaltar, please help me."," Of course, my dear. What can I do?", L556326, L556325,m540
 There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.," If there's a way in, there must be a way out.", L556329, L556328,m540
 There is a way., I knew it!, L556332, L556331,m540
 But it's impossible., Why?, L556334, L556333,m540
 Then teach me how.," No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.", L556338, L556337,m540
" Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life", Then come with me., L556341, L556340,m540
 Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?, You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers., L556343, L556342,m540
" Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?"," Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.", L556345, L556344,m540
 You're going to take me back?, Going to try. Didn't say I could., L556348, L556347,m540
" I heard my mother ask you once ""how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?"" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart."," Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!", L556350, L556349,m540
 You can use the wand., Better than when I was a child., L556383, L556382,m540
 What's that? Never saw anything like that., Don't stop. Keep moving., L556386, L556385,m540
" Yes, mustn't stop.", It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work., L556388, L556387,m540

 Yeah? What do you want?," Buddy, are we in trouble.", L556886, L556885,m541
 What?," First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?", L556888, L556887,m541

" Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?", Brad., L556905, L556904,m541
 Brad is not a good name for a cocktail., Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?, L556907, L556906,m541

 I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper., You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?, L580344, L580343,m556
" According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?", It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago., L580346, L580345,m556
 And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?, Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?, L580348, L580347,m556
 What was it?," When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.", L580351, L580350,m556
 What killed those men?," What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.", L580353, L580352,m556
 I'll know soon enough.," What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted", L580355, L580354,m556
 A plague?," The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.", L580357, L580356,m556
 Negotiating with whom?," I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.", L580359, L580358,m556
 And they tell me I'm paranoid.," Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.", L580361, L580360,m556
 How can I reach you?, You can't., L580363, L580362,m556
 You found something?, Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks., L580559, L580558,m556
 What?, I'm not sure. A virus --, L580561, L580560,m556
 -- You saw this experiment?, What did it look like?, L580563, L580562,m556
 What do you think?, A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus., L580567, L580566,m556
 That would be my guess., Your guess?, L580569, L580568,m556
 You told me you had answers.," Yeah, well I don't have them all.", L580572, L580571,m556
 You've been using me --, I've been using you?!, L580574, L580573,m556
 You didn't know my father --, I told you -- he and I were old friends --, L580576, L580575,m556
 You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you., Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters., L580580, L580579,m556
 Mulder -- it's me --," Where are you, Scully?", L580097, L580096,m556

 No. I haven't.," What's wrong, Scully?", L580101, L580100,m556

 I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street., I think they have that covered., L580105, L580104,m556
 Mulder...?, What happened to playing a hunch?, L580108, L580107,m556
" Jesus, Mulder..."," The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...", L580110, L580109,m556
" I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.", How's that?, L580113, L580112,m556
 You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol., What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome., L580115, L580114,m556
 Now what?, It's locked?, L580117, L580116,m556

" They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them."," They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.", L580196, L580195,m556
 What? What are you talking about?, I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment..., L580198, L580197,m556
 Why?, I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993., L580200, L580199,m556
 They were the ones that put us together.," Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.", L580202, L580201,m556
" This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me."," They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.", L580204, L580203,m556
 You're... quitting?," There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.", L580206, L580205,m556
 I wake you?, No., L580259, L580258,m556
" Are you drunk, Mulder?", I was until about an hour ago., L580262, L580261,m556
" What are you implying, Scully?", I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting., L580265, L580264,m556
" Go home, Mulder. It's late."," Get dressed, Scully.", L580268, L580267,m556

 This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?, According to this tag., L580303, L580302,m556
 It's like jelly., There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous., L580310, L580309,m556

 You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here., I'd been told as much., L580315, L580314,m556
 You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?, I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced., L580317, L580316,m556
" Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics."," We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?", L580319, L580318,m556

" -- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.", Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --, L580378, L580377,m556
 You said you weren't coming?, I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen., L580390, L580389,m556
 What did you find?," Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.", L580392, L580391,m556
 How was it contracted?," That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.", L580394, L580393,m556
 He didn't mention a park.," This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.", L580462, L580461,m556
 You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?," The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.", L580465, L580464,m556
 And you've never seen anything like that?, No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --, L580467, L580466,m556

" Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?", This is great. This is fitting., L580502, L580501,m556

 Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?, Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there., L580522, L580521,m556
 Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated., For the purpose of what?, L580524, L580523,m556

 I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use., I want to know where Scully is., L580667, L580666,m556
 What is it?, A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours., L580670, L580669,m556
 You're lying.," No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.", L580672, L580671,m556

" Oh, damn!  That's it.", It's better than nothing., L656948, L656947,m607
 It is?, He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard., L656950, L656949,m607
 No record of him., You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen., L656952, L656951,m607
 What's this?, Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train., L656954, L656953,m607
 Willard..., It's not a guy..., L656965, L656964,m607

 My God!  He's so excessive!, Where have you been?, L657115, L657114,m607
 Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!," Oh, I see, an easy plan!", L657121, L657120,m607
 The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!, He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!, L657149, L657148,m607
" All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.", In the next two minutes?, L657151, L657150,m607

 You didn't tell us you had this on!," My Lord, he was telling the truth!", L657060, L657059,m607
 He calls it the Tarantula., But it only has six legs., L657080, L657079,m607
 He's not giving up?," Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...", L657088, L657087,m607
" Time for you to get off, Ma'am.", Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!, L657107, L657106,m607
 A new friend?, We'll see., L656749, L656748,m607
 Anyone?, Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms., L656761, L656760,m607
" I could get used to this, looking down on people.", They don't even realize they should be frightened., L657094, L657093,m607
" My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am."," I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time.

 I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.," Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.", L656780, L656779,m607
" Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?"," I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.", L656782, L656781,m607

" Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that."," That'll be all, boys.", L656589, L656588,m607
 Good work.  Really., This is Colonel Richards., L656591, L656590,m607
 But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power., Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced., L656601, L656600,m607
 We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!," Nicely said, sir.", L656603, L656602,m607

" A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye."," A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.

 Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.

" You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?"," I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.", L664259, L664258,m614

 You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --," Control, Senator...  we teach them control.", L664265, L664264,m614
" This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -"," I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.

 You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?, Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator., L664309, L664308,m614
 Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.," Gosh, I hope so.", L664312, L664311,m614

 The point of what?," This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of ""team"" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?", L664431, L664430,m614
 The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings., What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery., L664433, L664432,m614

 Why is everybody up at sunrise?," The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.", L664411, L664410,m614

 Is that so?, Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively., L664353, L664352,m614

 Are you suggesting I call him master???," No, of course not.  I just meant...", L665985, L665984,m615
 Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.," Darling, you mustn't worry so.", L665999, L665998,m615
