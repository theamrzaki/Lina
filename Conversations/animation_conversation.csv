Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.", L239574, L239573,m75
 Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.," Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?", L239579, L239578,m75
" What do you mean by ""seen?""", Looked at with your eyes., L239581, L239580,m75

 You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.," Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.", L239642, L239641,m75
 This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod., You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress., L239645, L239644,m75
" Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.

" You'll never regret this, Ray."," My parents left me that house, I was born there.", L239652, L239651,m75
 You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days., But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy., L239654, L239653,m75
 But most people are afraid to even report these things., Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before., L239658, L239657,m75
 Wow!  Does this pole still work?," This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of ""pricey"" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.", L239663, L239662,m75

" I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?", No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy., L240174, L240173,m75
 Who was the architect?, He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor., L240176, L240175,m75

He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.", L406487, L406486,m144
" It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies."," I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.", L406489, L406488,m144
" Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail."," I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.", L406493, L406492,m144
" I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait."," Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?", L406538, L406537,m144
" Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.", I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation, L406540, L406539,m144
" If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion."," General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.", L406542, L406541,m144
" I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.", Proceed., L406544, L406543,m144
" But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death."," You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.", L406546, L406545,m144
 I have heard that story but I do not believe it.," Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.", L406548, L406547,m144
" The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time."," For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.", L406550, L406549,m144
" Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?"," Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.", L406552, L406551,m144
" You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that."," I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.", L406554, L406553,m144
" Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it."," Ah, yes -- proceed.", L406556, L406555,m144
" Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground."," I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?", L406560, L406559,m144
" Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter."," Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?", L406562, L406561,m144
" I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again."," Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.", L406564, L406563,m144
 Proceed.," If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.", L406566, L406565,m144
 What do you think Napoleon will do?," I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.", L406568, L406567,m144
" If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia."," General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.", L406570, L406569,m144
" And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander."," And, what a delightful idea!", L406368, L406367,m144
 Ah -- you approve?, I think it's absolutely charming., L406370, L406369,m144
 I'm glad you like it., Whatever suggested the idea to you?, L406372, L406371,m144
" You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down."," Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?", L406381, L406380,m144
" Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. ""Berthier sees only what is in the open,"" Murat said.  ""But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest.""  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment."," Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.", L406383, L406382,m144
 What do you mean?, I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals., L406385, L406384,m144
 Yes -- who spoke up?," I did, sir.", L405930, L405929,m144
" Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?"," Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.", L405932, L405931,m144

 Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?," No, thank you.", L405964, L405963,m144
 I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.," Things are quite serious, I should say.", L405966, L405965,m144
" We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.", What do you have in mind?, L405968, L405967,m144
" To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.", Are you serious?, L405970, L405969,m144
 I don't even know whether a defense is possible., What forces do you have at your disposal?, L405972, L405971,m144
" About 5,000 troops.", Cavalry?, L405974, L405973,m144
" The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.", Any cannon?, L405976, L405975,m144
 There are none here., Where are they?, L405978, L405977,m144
" Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.", You could have them here by daybreak., L405980, L405979,m144
" Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?"," Properly arranged, yes.", L405982, L405981,m144
 These are odds of 8 to 1.," The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.", L405984, L405983,m144
 Would you be prepared to handle this for me?, Are you proposing to transfer command to me?, L405986, L405985,m144
" In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.", Fair enough., L405988, L405987,m144
" I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.", I'm not insulted., L405990, L405989,m144
 You realize what is at stake?," Our lives, the revolution, my career?", L405992, L405991,m144
" Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?"," They are at the gates of Paris, sire.", L406597, L406596,m144
 And where is the army?," It is on this road, sire, following me.", L406599, L406598,m144
 And who is defending Paris?," Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.", L406601, L406600,m144
 Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.," Unhappily, it is true, sire.", L406603, L406602,m144
 But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?," The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.", L406605, L406604,m144
" But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.", A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?, L406610, L406609,m144
" I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.", But who made this treaty?, L406612, L406611,m144
 I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position., Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?, L406614, L406613,m144
" I don't know, sire.", And where is Joseph?, L406616, L406615,m144
 I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.," What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.", L406618, L406617,m144
 Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life., It is a terrible shock., L406634, L406633,m144
 But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?," I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.", L406636, L406635,m144
 She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!, That is incredible., L406638, L406637,m144
" Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.", I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken., L406640, L406639,m144

 How did it spread so quickly?, It is the work of incendiaries., L406529, L406528,m144
 I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting., Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!, L406531, L406530,m144

 I have met her.  What is your business with me?, I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession., L406012, L406011,m144
 That is correct.," This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.", L406014, L406013,m144

" Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?", No..., L406083, L406082,m144
 No... nothing at all., Not even the slightest hint of something?, L406088, L406087,m144
" No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other."," You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?", L406090, L406089,m144
" Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this."," And you, Junot?", L406092, L406091,m144
" The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts."," You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.", L406184, L406183,m144
 I know of no better time., You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce., L406186, L406185,m144
 The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already., You must not act impetuously., L406188, L406187,m144
 It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us., But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life., L406190, L406189,m144
 Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?, Are you trying to insult me?, L406193, L406192,m144
" Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder."," Well, you shall see.", L406195, L406194,m144
 When is she supposed to return?," I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.", L406197, L406196,m144
 She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.," My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.", L406199, L406198,m144
 Will you use the troops?, Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?, L406251, L406250,m144
" Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress."," I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.", L406465, L406464,m144
 Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?," I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.", L406467, L406466,m144
" Ah, that is good."," And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.", L406469, L406468,m144
" Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down."," Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.", L406028, L406027,m144
" Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?"," Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.", L406030, L406029,m144
 May I offer you a drink?," Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.", L406032, L406031,m144
" Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here."," You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?", L406034, L406033,m144
" I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon."," Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.", L406039, L406038,m144
 Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?," No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.", L406044, L406043,m144
 Were you in love with him?, I thought I was.  I was confused., L406201, L406200,m144
 And now?," Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.", L406203, L406202,m144
 Do you expect me to believe that?, Yes., L406205, L406204,m144
" And you, are you in love with any one else?", No., L406207, L406206,m144
 But you have had mistresses while you were away., Of course., L406209, L406208,m144
 Were you in love with any of them?, No., L406211, L406210,m144
 Were they pretty?, Yes., L406213, L406212,m144
 Were any of them prettier than I am?, One had better legs., L406215, L406214,m144
 Were any of them married?, Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting., L406217, L406216,m144
 She must have been in love with you.," Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.", L406219, L406218,m144
 Promise me you will never leave me., I cannot promise you that., L406221, L406220,m144
 Promise me., I will never forgive you., L406223, L406222,m144
" I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.", I don't understand you., L406225, L406224,m144
 Promise., Promises mean nothing., L406227, L406226,m144
" Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.", All right -- I promise., L406229, L406228,m144
 Yes -- what is it?, Open the door.  It's me., L406298, L406297,m144
 Go away -- I'm busy., I know what you're doing in there., L406300, L406299,m144
 Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working., Where is Madame Trillaud?, L406302, L406301,m144
 How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress., What are you doing in there?, L406304, L406303,m144
" Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once."," Will you be joining us, soon?", L406306, L406305,m144
 I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests., Five minutes., L406308, L406307,m144
 Yes!!, Five minutes., L406310, L406309,m144
 Separate bedrooms?, Yes., L406320, L406319,m144
 But you will not... be safe..., Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?, L406322, L406321,m144
 Who is it?, It's me., L406325, L406324,m144
 I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.," Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.", L406329, L406328,m144
" Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins."," Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.", L406331, L406330,m144
" No, one cannot simply ignore it."," I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.", L406086, L406085,m144
 I believe you sent for me.," Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.", L406104, L406103,m144
" God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?", There's probably some explanation., L406110, L406109,m144
" Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles?  I asked for it yesterday.", I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon., L406113, L406112,m144
 Why did you give it to him?," I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.", L406115, L406114,m144
" Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier."," I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.", L406117, L406116,m144
 I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?, He's downstairs -- somewhere., L406119, L406118,m144
" Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?", Certainly., L406122, L406121,m144
 I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph., Why not?, L406124, L406123,m144
" Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.", What are you talking about?, L406126, L406125,m144
 Nothing.  That's all I can say., That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?, L406128, L406127,m144
 That's all I can say.," Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.", L406130, L406129,m144
" Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.", There are some things... better left unsaid., L406133, L406132,m144
 What the hell is the matter with you?, I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you., L406136, L406135,m144
" Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!", You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?, L406138, L406137,m144
 Yes., I wrote it., L406140, L406139,m144
 What?," Yes, I wrote it.", L406142, L406141,m144
 You wrote it., I couldn't face telling you., L406144, L406143,m144
 You couldn't face telling me what?, About Hippolyte Charles., L406146, L406145,m144
 What was there to tell?," My God, what do you think?", L406148, L406147,m144
 Do you know what you're saying?, God help me -- yes., L406150, L406149,m144
 How do you know?, I know., L406152, L406151,m144
" I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.", Yes?, L406155, L406154,m144
 You could hear them?, Yes., L406158, L406157,m144
 You mean you heard them making love?, Yes., L406160, L406159,m144
 How did you know it was Captain Charles?," I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.", L406162, L406161,m144
" Can you give me a drink, please?"," Yes, of course.  What do you want?", L406164, L406163,m144
 I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself., And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?, L406166, L406165,m144
" Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?"," My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.", L406475, L406474,m144
" Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?"," No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.", L406477, L406476,m144
" May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me."," Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.", L406479, L406478,m144
" If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?"," If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.", L406481, L406480,m144
" Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you."," Oh, then you are...", L406433, L406432,m144
" And, where did you see my portrait?"," Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.", L406437, L406436,m144
" And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?"," You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.", L406440, L406439,m144
 Do you like music?," Yes, I do -- very much.", L406443, L406442,m144
 Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.," Of course, my dear.", L406445, L406444,m144
 You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?," You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.", L406447, L406446,m144
 I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside., I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside., L406449, L406448,m144
" I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn."," I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.", L406451, L406450,m144
" Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much."," Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.", L406453, L406452,m144
" Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.", Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?, L406455, L406454,m144
 Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.," Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.", L406457, L406456,m144
 Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?, No., L406459, L406458,m144
" Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.", Does she deserve anything better?, L406388, L406387,m144
 Those are extremely harsh terms., I did not ask her to go to war against me., L406390, L406389,m144
 Has Alexander agreed to this?," Yes, he has.", L406392, L406391,m144
" Now, the section headed ""Secret Clauses of the Treaty"" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.", That is correct., L406394, L406393,m144
 Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?," I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.", L406396, L406395,m144
 England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard., We have a treaty with Austria., L406398, L406397,m144
" Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses."," My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.", L406400, L406399,m144
 What I am talking about is moderation.," What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.", L406402, L406401,m144
 And where do you place Alexander?, Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding., L406404, L406403,m144
" I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.", That is a matter of opinion., L406406, L406405,m144
" Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.", He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do., L406408, L406407,m144
 Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?," I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?", L405904, L405903,m144
" A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin."," You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.", L405908, L405907,m144
" Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone."," No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.", L405910, L405909,m144
" Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform."," Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.", L405912, L405911,m144
 I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.," Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.", L405915, L405914,m144
 What did you say his name was?, Eugene de Beauharnais., L406002, L406001,m144
 Is he alone?," Yes, sir.", L406004, L406003,m144
 Come in.," Major Lavallette to see you, General.", L406246, L406245,m144
 Come in., A message from Citizen Fouche., L406254, L406253,m144

" Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.", My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me., L405854, L405853,m144
 His moods at this time were complex and varied., Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure, L405871, L405870,m144
" He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline."," It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.", L405873, L405872,m144
" Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him."," From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.", L406062, L406061,m144
" On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  ""I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."""," Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.", L406281, L406280,m144
" Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms."," If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.", L406362, L406361,m144
" I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland."," With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.", L406506, L406505,m144
" On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him."," A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.", L406589, L406588,m144

 Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!, Then come find me., L41132, L41131,m242
 Who did you hear it from?, I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?, L41198, L41197,m242

 Will he finish what he begins?, We've come this far ... He is our only hope., L192086, L192085,m337
 Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.," You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.", L192345, L192344,m337
" Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship."," Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.", L192353, L192352,m337
" Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.", The boy is our last hope., L192356, L192355,m337
 I can't ...," You must.  Luke, look at me!", L191657, L191656,m337
" You must survive, Luke.", I'm cold ... so cold ..., L191659, L191658,m337
" You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.", Ben ... Ben ..., L191661, L191660,m337
" ... Luke, you must not go.", But Han and Leia will surely die., L192331, L192330,m337
 You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate., I can help them!, L192333, L192332,m337
 You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn., I feel The Force., L192335, L192334,m337
 Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer., And that is why I must go., L192340, L192339,m337
" Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.", You won't., L192342, L192341,m337
" How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?", Growls a reserved greeting., L192257, L192256,m337
 Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.," Everyone's invited, of course.", L192315, L192314,m337
 Barks a blue streak., What's wrong with him?, L192440, L192439,m337

" Well, it's been awhile.", Barks and growls at his boss., L192242, L192241,m337
 Howls and shrugs his shoulders., Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?, L192306, L192305,m337
 Barks at Han.," Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?", L192324, L192323,m337
 Barks his concern.," No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.", L192376, L192375,m337
 Barks a doleful farewell.," I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.", L192415, L192414,m337
 Barks at his master., What happened?, L192300, L192299,m337
 We should have stayed and finished them off., Barks his agreement., L192472, L192471,m337

" Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.", Barks his agreement., L192549, L192548,m337
 ... Like we're being watched., Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm., L191995, L191994,m337
 I'm looking for someone., Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!, L191997, L191996,m337
 Yeah ..., Help you I can ... yes ... yes., L191999, L191998,m337
 I'm looking for a great warrior., A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great., L192001, L192000,m337
" Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...", Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?, L192006, L192005,m337
 Give me that!, Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not., L192008, L192007,m337
 I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole., Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is., L192010, L192009,m337
" Mine, mine."," Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.", L192014, L192013,m337
" No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.", I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master., L192016, L192015,m337
" Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.", You know the Jedi Master?, L192018, L192017,m337
" ... I told you, I'm not hungry.", Patience.  It's time to eat., L192061, L192060,m337
" Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now."," It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.", L192063, L192062,m337
 Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?," Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?", L192065, L192064,m337
" Because of my father, I guess."," Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.", L192067, L192066,m337
 Yes sir!," Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?", L191640, L191639,m337
 I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.," Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!", L191642, L191641,m337
" Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.", Not likely!  Where are the speeders?, L191649, L191648,m337
 We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ..., We'll have to go out on Tauntauns., L191651, L191650,m337
 The temperature is dropping too fast., You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it., L191653, L191652,m337
 The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker., Then I'll see you in Hell., L191655, L191654,m337
" What is thy bidding, My Master?", There is a grave disturbance in The Force., L192091, L192090,m337
 I have felt it., Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction., L192093, L192092,m337
 Our destruction?  Who?, The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing., L192095, L192094,m337
" He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...", You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed., L192097, L192096,m337
" But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.", Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset., L192099, L192098,m337
 Captain Solo.  What's the situation?," There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.", L191594, L191593,m337
" Good, and Commander Skywalker?", He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon., L191596, L191595,m337
" With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.", The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going., L191598, L191597,m337
 That's right., You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you., L191601, L191600,m337
" Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man."," I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.", L191603, L191602,m337
" Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.", Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you., L191710, L191709,m337
" Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?", What is it?, L191633, L191632,m337
" Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.", I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?, L191635, L191634,m337
" I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?", Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon., L191644, L191643,m337
" He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.", I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ..., L191685, L191684,m337
 Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!, The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever., L191857, L191856,m337
" Sir, I was wondering ..."," Sit down, and shut up!", L191896, L191895,m337
 I think we're in trouble.," If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.", L191906, L191905,m337
 What are you so grouchy about?," Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?", L191969, L191968,m337
" You, too, golden rod.", I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior., L191988, L191987,m337
 It sounds like it's trying to get in., I'm going to see what it is., L192106, L192105,m337
" We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ..."," Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...", L192126, L192125,m337
" I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir."," Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.", L192157, L192156,m337
" Yes, Your Highness?", You said you were going to stay. What happened?, L191607, L191606,m337
 That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind., Does Luke know?, L191609, L191608,m337
" He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head."," Han, we need you here.", L191611, L191610,m337
 We?, Yes., L191613, L191612,m337
 Not you?, Me?  I don't know what you mean., L191615, L191614,m337
 You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...," And what are they, pray tell?", L191617, L191616,m337
 You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.," I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.", L191619, L191618,m337
 Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss., I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee., L191622, L191621,m337
" There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.", We are fighting for a cause much ..., L191624, L191623,m337
 Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet., And you think you're the one to apply some heat?, L191626, L191625,m337
" Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...", Forget it., L191688, L191687,m337
 Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.," No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.", L191691, L191690,m337
 .... I'm afraid there's not much left., What was it?, L191713, L191712,m337
 Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ...., An Imperial probe droid., L191715, L191714,m337
" Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.", I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from., L191759, L191758,m337
 I don't know what he's talking about., Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet., L191765, L191764,m337
 You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.," Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?", L191769, L191768,m337
" Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder."," Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?", L191771, L191770,m337
 Hey!  Someone's still in here.," Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.", L191851, L191850,m337
 Would it help if I got out and pushed?," Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.", L191869, L191868,m337
 This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade., This baby's got a few surprises left in her., L191873, L191872,m337
" I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?", Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us., L191893, L191892,m337
 That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ...., Or you ran into something ...., L191919, L191918,m337
" Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...", Probably an asteroid field ...., L191921, L191920,m337
 Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need., To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?, L191923, L191922,m337
" Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.", I take it back., L191934, L191933,m337
 That Star Destroyer is slowing down., Good., L191936, L191935,m337
 But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer., I'm against that., L191938, L191937,m337
 We've got to get out of this shower., Now you're making sense., L191940, L191939,m337
" There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.", What is it?, L191946, L191945,m337
" Why, Princess, this is so sudden.", Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry., L191976, L191975,m337
 You don't look angry., How do I look?, L191978, L191977,m337
" Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited."," Well, I hope you don't expect more.", L191982, L191981,m337
" I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.", Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go., L191984, L191983,m337
 That was no earthquake., Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser., L192031, L192030,m337
 They're moving away., They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe., L192034, L192033,m337
" Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.", Would you please stop calling me that?, L192039, L192038,m337
 Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.," Yes, you do.", L192041, L192040,m337
" Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.", That's quite a compliment., L192044, L192043,m337
 Stop that., Why?, L192046, L192045,m337
 What are you afraid of?, Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy., L192049, L192048,m337
 Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.," Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.", L192053, L192052,m337
 There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized., You mean a man you can control., L192055, L192054,m337
 I do not!, Try and control this ..., L192057, L192056,m337
 There's something out there!, Where?, L192103, L192102,m337
 Are you crazy!," Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...", L192108, L192107,m337
 Looks like some kind of Mynock., There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now., L192112, L192111,m337
 Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.," Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!", L192121, L192120,m337
" I see it Chewie, hang on.", The entrance is collapsing!, L192124, L192123,m337
" Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.", No lightspeed?, L192161, L192160,m337
" Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.", You're going to attack them?!!!, L192166, L192165,m337
 You could have warned him before you shut him off.," Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?", L192208, L192207,m337
 I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.," Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.", L192210, L192209,m337
 What'd you have in mind for your next move?, The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed., L192212, L192211,m337
" Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?", Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?, L192214, L192213,m337
 That depends.  Where are we?, Here ... near the Anoat system., L192216, L192215,m337
" Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs."," You keep logs?  My, how organized.", L192218, L192217,m337
" Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.", Never heard of that system., L192220, L192219,m337
" Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.", A mining colony., L192222, L192221,m337
" A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.", Can you trust him?, L192224, L192223,m337
" You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them."," Let ╘er go, Chewie.", L192228, L192227,m337
 I don't like this., It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here., L192250, L192249,m337
 What are you staring at?, Who's staring?, L192292, L192291,m337
 You look silly., You look great., L192294, L192293,m337
 Has Threepio turned up yet?, Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out., L192296, L192295,m337
 I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right., Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now., L192298, L192297,m337
 He found him in a junk pile ...," Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.", L192302, L192301,m337
" Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident."," Chewie, do you think you can repair him?", L192304, L192303,m337
 No thanks.," Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...", L192308, L192307,m337
 I was worried about you., I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to., L192378, L192377,m337
" ... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true."," ... just remember that, ╘cause I'll be back ...", L192417, L192416,m337
" Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?", I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings., L191586, L191585,m337
 There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base., I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long., L191588, L191587,m337
" Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.", Thanks to you., L191756, L191755,m337
 Probe?  What probe?, That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight., L191761, L191760,m337
 About what?," Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.", L191767, L191766,m337
 I hope you make your peace with Jabba., Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us., L191798, L191797,m337
" Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.", No hard feelings?, L192252, L192251,m337
 Are you kidding?, I always said you were a gentleman., L192254, L192253,m337
" That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?", Repairs ..., L192264, L192263,m337
 That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?, Hyperdrive., L192268, L192267,m337
 How's your mining operation going?, Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?, L192271, L192270,m337
" Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.", I'm sorry too., L192327, L192326,m337

 Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream., You see the couple up in the balcony?, L410469, L410468,m457
 That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa., He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?, L410471, L410470,m457
 Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier., The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?, L410473, L410472,m457
" That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.", We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night., L410538, L410537,m457
 Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake., Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?, L410594, L410593,m457
" As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.", What are you talking about?, L410596, L410595,m457

" An odd selection, Mr Case.", I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest., L410695, L410694,m457
 Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil., Can you read my mind?, L410697, L410696,m457
" You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You...

 Tell me the words., The words?, L410706, L410705,m457
 The access code to your mainframe.," Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.", L410708, L410707,m457
" What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?"," Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.", L410710, L410709,m457

" Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct."," Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.", L410306, L410305,m457

 She's ready to go.," Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.", L410610, L410609,m457

 Ready?," I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.", L410895, L410894,m457
 Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?," Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.", L410901, L410900,m457
" Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.", Jah guides us., L410905, L410904,m457
 What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?, Right..., L410312, L410311,m457
 I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine., You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special., L410314, L410313,m457

 I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.," I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.", L410373, L410372,m457
 Who got you into this?, A guy who calls himself Armitage., L410375, L410374,m457
 Never heard of him., Nobody has., L410377, L410376,m457
 I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?," No problem, amigo.", L410379, L410378,m457
" What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it."," Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.", L410381, L410380,m457

 Bright enough to be dangerous., That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe., L410553, L410552,m457
" He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.", Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him., L410555, L410554,m457
 It's possible. The guy was a blank slate., So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense., L410557, L410556,m457
 Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs., No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful., L410559, L410558,m457
" Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it."," The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?", L410561, L410560,m457

" Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?", We run. You crack the pattern?, L410678, L410677,m457
" Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.", You can make your move when it comes after me., L410680, L410679,m457
 What are you talkin' about?, I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix., L410682, L410681,m457
 It'll flatline your ass., Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?, L410685, L410684,m457

 Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.," How long, Dixie?", L410772, L410771,m457
 Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.," Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.", L410774, L410773,m457

 You haven't got it?," I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.", L410845, L410844,m457

 What about the route to the core?, I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive., L410858, L410857,m457
" You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...", Case., L410497, L410496,m457
 What about the mainframe's access code?, 3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code., L410545, L410544,m457
 Wait... You hear that?, What?, L410806, L410805,m457
 Want to fucking answer them?, No!... No..., L410810, L410809,m457
" Hello, Case.", I thought you already left., L410107, L410106,m457
" Why did you come here tonight, Linda?", People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you., L410110, L410109,m457
 I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me., This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score., L410112, L410111,m457
 Where did you here that?," Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.", L410114, L410113,m457
 Case... are you okay?, I don't know. I don't know..., L410877, L410876,m457
 I know who you are.," There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.", L410439, L410438,m457
 And we really do have to talk., You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed., L410441, L410440,m457
 I had to limit your options., And Linda..., L410443, L410442,m457
 You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.," I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.", L410445, L410444,m457
" Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.", Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out., L410447, L410446,m457
" I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences.

 I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.," I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.", L410455, L410454,m457
 His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you., Why should I want to meet him., L410142, L410141,m457
" Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.", What's my end?, L410144, L410143,m457
 What is it?, ... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip., L410148, L410147,m457
 Sorry. That's not gonna happen.," Then, fuck you. I'm gone.", L410150, L410149,m457
 Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?, Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition., L410181, L410180,m457
" He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?", Couple of months., L410183, L410182,m457

 How soon is soon enough?, Couple of days. They'll examine you., L410212, L410211,m457
 That's not going to help.," The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.", L410214, L410213,m457

" When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him.

 Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him., Too late?, L410265, L410264,m457

" Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.", Dixie McCoy didn't., L410271, L410270,m457

 Taste it., But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place., L414982, L414981,m459
 Taste it., No., L414984, L414983,m459
 Why not?, I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart., L414986, L414985,m459
 But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.," Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.", L414990, L414989,m459

 Dr. Zaius --," Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?", L443374, L443373,m473
" Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes."," You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?", L443376, L443375,m473
 He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.," Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...", L443520, L443519,m473
 How did you know we'd come here?, It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous., L443674, L443673,m473
" I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason."," We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.", L443677, L443676,m473
" Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...", Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable., L443700, L443699,m473
 I apologize.," To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.", L443702, L443701,m473
 A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.," Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'", L443712, L443711,m473
" No sir, I haven't forgotten.", Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets., L443714, L443713,m473
 Seal the cave?, That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy., L443797, L443796,m473
" Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.", Do you have any weapons?, L443611, L443610,m473
 The best. But we won't need them.," Just the same, I want one.", L443613, L443612,m473
 As you wish., Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?, L443617, L443616,m473
" To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours."," You still don't believe me, do you?", L443621, L443620,m473
 Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.," Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.", L443624, L443623,m473
 Where does the river lead?, It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is., L443647, L443646,m473
 You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone., No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly., L443651, L443650,m473
 When are you going to show me what's in the cave?," Right now, if you like.", L443662, L443661,m473
" If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it."," Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.", L443669, L443668,m473

" Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.", What are you doing there?, L443717, L443716,m473
 That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.," And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.", L443751, L443750,m473
 They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture., Good luck then., L443774, L443773,m473
 Do you have to work tonight?, No., L443300, L443299,m473
 That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about., What's so special about him?, L443303, L443302,m473
 Look -- she remembers., Remembers what?, L443306, L443305,m473
 The blood transfusion.," Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.", L443308, L443307,m473
 It's a stunt. Humans don't write.," Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?", L443334, L443333,m473
" Now, just a minute --"," Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.", L443340, L443339,m473
 'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know., And they fell out of the sky with you?, L443342, L443341,m473
 Flight is a scientific impossibility.," And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?", L443345, L443344,m473
" Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?", No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it., L443352, L443351,m473
" 'Then how do you account for me?,", I don't. And I'm not going to try., L443354, L443353,m473
 But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.," Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?", L443356, L443355,m473
" Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it."," No, they won't -", L443358, L443357,m473
 Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -, It's probably wrong --, L443360, L443359,m473
" -- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -", The evidence was very meager --, L443362, L443361,m473
 You didn't think so then., That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy., L443364, L443363,m473
 'I am not a missing link.'," Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.", L443368, L443367,m473
" Well, maybe they're not."," No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.", L443370, L443369,m473
" Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!"," Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --", L443372, L443371,m473
 A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it., Zira...., L443390, L443389,m473
 How did it go?, There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us., L443607, L443606,m473
" We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.", Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon., L443631, L443630,m473

 No.," Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.", L443158, L443157,m473
 Which direction?, That way., L443160, L443159,m473
 Any particular reason?, None at all., L443162, L443161,m473

" This place is dirty, doctor."," These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?", L443234, L443233,m473
 But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?," What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.", L443240, L443239,m473
 You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment., That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value., L443242, L443241,m473

 Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?, Don't bother, L443183, L443182,m473
 Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative., But I'm not prepared to die., L443185, L443184,m473
 Scarecrows?, Let's take a look., L443197, L443196,m473

 Who are you?, So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --, L443578, L443577,m473
 She comes along too., Zira doesn't want your female., L443582, L443581,m473

 Shouldn't we be moving on?, I'm for that., L443653, L443652,m473
 Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?, In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair., L443659, L443658,m473
" Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.", Always giving orders. Just like every other adult., L443693, L443692,m473
" Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?", Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --, L443734, L443733,m473
" All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.", What is it?, L443736, L443735,m473
 I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.," Yes, I can do that.", L443738, L443737,m473
 They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?, I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose., L443762, L443761,m473
 Lucius., I think you're making a mistake., L443780, L443779,m473
 That's the boy. Keep 'em flying., What?, L443782, L443781,m473
 I told you not to bring the other one., He wouldn't leave her., L443587, L443586,m473

" Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.", Why special?, L443382, L443381,m473
 You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here., My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation., L443444, L443443,m473

 Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down., My name is Taylor., L443459, L443458,m473
 It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself., This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story..., L443461, L443460,m473
 One is in a museum!, Dr. Zira! Silence that man!, L443494, L443493,m473
" You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!", Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!, L443514, L443513,m473

You may proceed, Dr. Honorius."," By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.", L443442, L443441,m473
" Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.", Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something., L443454, L443453,m473

 How so?," Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.

 Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?, With one of them., L443504, L443503,m473
 What about me?," Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?", L443543, L443542,m473
 No.," Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.", L443545, L443544,m473

 You lied. Where is your tribe?," My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.", L443549, L443548,m473
" Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?", What about it?, L443551, L443550,m473
" A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?", I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira., L443553, L443552,m473
 Certainly not.," That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.", L443555, L443554,m473
 Of course.," All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?", L443557, L443556,m473
 Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --, Then you admit --, L443559, L443558,m473
" I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?"," Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?", L443561, L443560,m473
" You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?", I don't know., L443563, L443562,m473
" If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.", I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?, L443565, L443564,m473
 Stop right there., Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned., L443667, L443666,m473
 There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.," All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.", L443683, L443682,m473

 Sure.," Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?", L443768, L443767,m473
" Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?"," Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.", L443786, L443785,m473
 What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.," The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.", L443788, L443787,m473

 You! ... You knew about this?," No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.", L443509, L443508,m473

" What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?", She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant., L443655, L443654,m473
 And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.," Taylor, please --", L443680, L443679,m473
 Taylor! Tell him., He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls., L443710, L443709,m473
 Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.," Taylor, you can't.", L443742, L443741,m473
" Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.", Why not?, L443747, L443746,m473
 It's humiliating., Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?, L443749, L443748,m473
 Would you like to come along?, We can't., L443771, L443770,m473

 Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.," I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.", L443487, L443486,m473
 Do you believe him?," Like you, I find it difficult.", L443489, L443488,m473
 But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture., This is his assertion., L443491, L443490,m473
" How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?", He doesn't know., L443496, L443495,m473
" Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.", Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity., L443524, L443523,m473

" Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman."," I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?", L470975, L470974,m492
" Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.", You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold., L470977, L470976,m492
 My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...," C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?", L470983, L470982,m492
" And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.", So where is it then?, L470987, L470986,m492
 My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property., Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?, L470992, L470991,m492
" Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown."," Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?", L470856, L470855,m492
" Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'."," Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?", L470858, L470857,m492
" That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.", Shoulda guessed., L470860, L470859,m492
 He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.," Big on the musical comedy, huh?", L470862, L470861,m492
" What's this, Roger?", A tweeting bird?, L470782, L470781,m492
" Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.", I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times., L470786, L470785,m492
 Don't worry about me.  I can take it., I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe., L470788, L470787,m492
" So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!", Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money., L470830, L470829,m492
 This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow., You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket., L470832, L470831,m492
 Is this paper even good?, Check the scrawl., L470834, L470833,m492
" Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.", What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks., L470957, L470956,m492
 A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.," No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?", L470961, L470960,m492
 Do you think the rabbit did it?, I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink., L470969, L470968,m492
" Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.", Thanks for the vote of confidence., L470985, L470984,m492
" The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie."," Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?", L470990, L470989,m492
 So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?, He's a Toon... who cares?, L470998, L470997,m492
" Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?"," Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.", L471048, L471047,m492
 He's a riot.," Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?", L471054, L471053,m492
 So you decided to help him after all?, I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?, L471057, L471056,m492
" Can you get him out of it, Eddie?", If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this., L471066, L471065,m492
" So what's the scam, Eddie?"," Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.", L471073, L471072,m492
 Maybe they just took it out of his pocket., Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open., L471079, L471078,m492
" Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?"," Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.", L471083, L471082,m492
 What was <u>that</u>?, <u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife., L471198, L471197,m492
 The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?, Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife., L471200, L471199,m492
 I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.," Maroon, right?", L471202, L471201,m492
 Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again., What the hell would they want with a gag factory?, L471204, L471203,m492
 What's that comin' from the bar?, Sounds like singin'., L471207, L471206,m492
 I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you., I'll bet., L471314, L471313,m492
" Are you gonna call him, Eddie?"," What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?", L471316, L471315,m492
 Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.," That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?", L471318, L471317,m492
 He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.," Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?", L470924, L470923,m492
 Men?  They look more like weasles to me.," Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?", L470930, L470929,m492
 Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures., So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?, L470932, L470931,m492
" Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?", Ask her..., L471128, L471127,m492
" Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court."," He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.", L471132, L471131,m492
 They must've taken it off me., They?, L471137, L471136,m492
" Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown."," Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.", L471140, L471139,m492
 You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?, Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there., L471143, L471142,m492
 I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.," You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...", L471145, L471144,m492
" I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried."," Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.", L471253, L471252,m492
" Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector."," Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.", L471258, L471257,m492
" These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.", The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal., L471410, L471409,m492
 No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally., So you're Cloverleaf?, L471424, L471423,m492
" Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?", It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use., L471427, L471426,m492
 Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?, They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?, L471441, L471440,m492
" Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.", What the hell's a freeway?, L471444, L471443,m492
" A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another."," That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.", L471446, L471445,m492
" Holy shit, he's a Toon!", Surprised?, L471482, L471481,m492
 You?," That's right, me.", L471487, L471486,m492
 Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.," Earl... it's me, Valiant.", L471151, L471150,m492
" Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?", Toon cops worked me over., L471153, L471152,m492
" Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo."," What am I, Earl?", L471155, L471154,m492
 You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig., No..., L471157, L471156,m492
 Does it hurt?, Not much.  It's hard to talk., L471159, L471158,m492
 Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?," Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.", L471130, L471129,m492
" Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.", That's because I don't have a doorbell., L471168, L471167,m492
" Oh... well, I... I just had to see you."," Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.", L471170, L471169,m492
" Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?", Toons aren't given imperfections., L471173, L471172,m492
" No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.", You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything., L471175, L471174,m492
" Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work."," No, no, no... I love my husband.", L471177, L471176,m492
" Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home."," Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.", L471179, L471178,m492
" Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do."," I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.", L471181, L471180,m492
 So altruistic., It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?, L471185, L471184,m492
" Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder."," If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?", L471187, L471186,m492
 You shot Roger., That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon., L471377, L471376,m492
" Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong."," Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.", L471379, L471378,m492
" It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?", Why didn't you tell me?, L471383, L471382,m492
 I didn't know who I could trust.," We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.", L471385, L471384,m492
 Where is he?, He's right here in the..., L471387, L471386,m492
 How did you get onto Doom?, Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will., L471391, L471390,m492
 So where is it?," When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.", L471393, L471392,m492
" Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli..."," Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?", L471396, L471395,m492
 Hold on a second.," Eddie, come on.", L471406, L471405,m492
 Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit., That's what you woke me up for?, L470903, L470902,m492
 Now what?, Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile., L470906, L470905,m492
 They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day., What a gasser., L470909, L470908,m492
 Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?, No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since., L470940, L470939,m492
 What's with the dip?," That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.", L470951, L470950,m492
 What the hell is that?, Doom., L471492, L471491,m492
" Valiant, did you see the rabbit?"," He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?", L470794, L470793,m492
" How much do you know about show business, Valiant?"," Only there's no business like it, no business I know.", L470802, L470801,m492
" Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?", One too many safes dropped on his head?, L470804, L470803,m492
" Here's the problem...  ""Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger"".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.", So what do you want me to do?, L470807, L470806,m492
 Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with., I don't work in Toontown., L470809, L470808,m492
 You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there., The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks., L470811, L470810,m492
 A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous., So's the job., L470813, L470812,m492
 I got him on loan from Disney., Aren't you the lucky one..., L470818, L470817,m492
 When will I hear from you?, As soon as is humanly possible., L470820, L470819,m492
" Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black."," Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.", L470888, L470887,m492
" Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee..."," Sure, Valiant, sure...", L470894, L470893,m492
" Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?", Valiant?  What're you doin' here?, L471096, L471095,m492
 I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph., I've already seen your photographs., L471098, L471097,m492
 Maroon?  Whaddaya want?, Have you got the will?, L471321, L471320,m492
 Maybe.  Why?, Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing., L471323, L471322,m492
 Valiant!  You surprised me., That was the idea., L471339, L471338,m492
" You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?"," No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.", L471341, L471340,m492
" Well, everybody needs a hobby."," No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.", L471343, L471342,m492
" You got the will in there, don't ya?"," No, I don't.", L471346, L471345,m492
" You tricked me, damn you!", Take it easy., L471348, L471347,m492
 Pattycake!  Pattycake!, Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it., L470882, L470881,m492
" My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.", Divorce?  Never!, L470897, L470896,m492
 Aah!, Aah!, L471001, L471000,m492
 What the hell are you doin'?," I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.", L471003, L471002,m492
 So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.," Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.", L471005, L471004,m492
" Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?"," Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.", L471007, L471006,m492
" Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.", Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran., L471017, L471016,m492
" If you're so innocent, why'd you run?"," Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.", L471019, L471018,m492
 Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding..., You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs., L471034, L471033,m492
 Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?," Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.", L471038, L471037,m492
 Does this help?," Yeah, that's better.", L471059, L471058,m492
 You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?," Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.", L471061, L471060,m492
" Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?"," My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.", L471063, L471062,m492
" Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.", I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent., L471070, L471069,m492
 The habeus corpus is thickening., Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will., L471075, L471074,m492
 How do you know that?," Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.", L471077, L471076,m492
" Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?"," Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?", L471081, L471080,m492
" Hey, don't I get an encore?"," Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.", L471215, L471214,m492
" But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh."," And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!", L471217, L471216,m492
" Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...", An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison., L471219, L471218,m492
 Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in., Just because you got 'em to laugh?, L471221, L471220,m492
" A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.", I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety., L471223, L471222,m492
" I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!"," Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.", L471225, L471224,m492
" Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?"," A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.", L471255, L471254,m492
" Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me."," But, Eddie, you know what happens when...", L471260, L471259,m492
" Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter..."," If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?", L471264, L471263,m492
 Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?, My brother.  Get inside., L471289, L471288,m492
" So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?", We can't do anything till it's dark., L471291, L471290,m492
" Say, who's this guy laughin'?", Me., L471294, L471293,m492
" Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?"," What is this, Twenty Questions?", L471296, L471295,m492
 You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!," Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?", L471300, L471299,m492
" You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.", A Toon?  Noooo., L471302, L471301,m492
" Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother."," Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.", L471304, L471303,m492
" Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.", Safe?, L471306, L471305,m492
 I'll get it., Get away from there., L471309, L471308,m492
