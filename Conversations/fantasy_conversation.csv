 Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?, What?, L8030, L8029,m7
 The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it., I don't want to., L8032, L8031,m7
 Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you., But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that., L8034, L8033,m7
 Rick...I can't., Never say can't.  Just do what I do., L8037, L8036,m7
" Alice, you think you can leave?", What's wrong?, L8095, L8094,m7
 Kincaid and Joey died last night., What?, L8097, L8096,m7
 You alright?, Kristen..., L8156, L8155,m7
 I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?, It was bad., L8197, L8196,m7
 Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?, I can't find him., L8199, L8198,m7
" Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's."," It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.", L8201, L8200,m7
 I can't go back to sleep again., I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen..., L8204, L8203,m7
 We'll figure it out., Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me., L8207, L8206,m7
 Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.," Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.", L8049, L8048,m7
 I'm sure they're around.," Yeah, I'm not so sure.", L8051, L8050,m7
" I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.", You could do worse., L8053, L8052,m7
 My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?, Sounds like a game show host to me., L8055, L8054,m7
" No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up."," Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?", L8057, L8056,m7
 I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control., How'd you learn so much about dreams?, L8059, L8058,m7
 You what?, When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying., L8063, L8062,m7
" Kristen, what happened?"," You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.", L8101, L8100,m7
 You in a hurry?, I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test., L8084, L8083,m7
 I know.  I hardly have any time to study., Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life., L8086, L8085,m7
" Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.", We have matching luggage., L8174, L8173,m7
 You've been up all night?," That obvious, huh?", L8177, L8176,m7
" Then you saw him, too?"," Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...", L8179, L8178,m7
 No...," You're his sister, right?", L8077, L8076,m7
 Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.," Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.", L8079, L8078,m7
 I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.," It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.", L8162, L8161,m7
 I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...," ""In her dream""?", L8166, L8165,m7
" No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!", Kristen's story really got to her., L8190, L8189,m7
 I've been working double shifts.," Extra money, huh?", L8211, L8210,m7
" No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow."," The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.", L8214, L8213,m7
 How long have you been awake?, Three days., L8216, L8215,m7
" Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?", Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him., L8218, L8217,m7
 Not really., Is there something we can do?, L8247, L8246,m7
 You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him., Why can't we just talk to the authorities?, L8251, L8250,m7
" Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.", Then what else can we do?, L8253, L8252,m7
 Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us., Who?, L8255, L8254,m7
" He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him."," Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.", L8274, L8273,m7
 You just feel sorry for me.," Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.", L8276, L8275,m7
 As long as your driving doesn't kill us.," It's okay, we're just about there.", L8278, L8277,m7
 He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.," You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.", L8288, L8287,m7
 Here we are., Something's wrong here.  It feels like..., L8290, L8289,m7
 What the hell was that?," Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.", L8295, L8294,m7
 You look great!, Save it for later.  Come on!, L8324, L8323,m7
" Rick, please."," Alright, I think I see salvation...", L7996, L7995,m7
 I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them., Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep., L8092, L8091,m7
 Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor., It was Freddy., L8185, L8184,m7
 Enough of that crap., I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in..., L8187, L8186,m7
 T-T-Thanks Alice..., Earth to Alice..., L7994, L7993,m7
" Hey, Rick!"," Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.", L8099, L8098,m7
 I don't get it., Let me talk to you., L8120, L8119,m7
 So what's up?  What'd I miss?, She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality., L8122, L8121,m7
 So?," It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down", L8124, L8123,m7
 Nice neighborhood.," Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.", L8126, L8125,m7
" Hey man, we're all sorry...", She knew she was gonna die., L8159, L8158,m7
 Been up with Alice., How she doing?  I ran into her last night., L8226, L8225,m7
" She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.", About Freddy?, L8228, L8227,m7
 Something the matter with the cuisine?," Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.", L8135, L8134,m7
 What's wrong with me?, Your distraught.  It'll help..., L8138, L8137,m7
" I'm sorry honey, but..."," Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!", L8141, L8140,m7
" Honey, we went over this in therapy."," Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...", L8143, L8142,m7
 Something wrong with the stairs?, Avoid-all-contact-day., L7982, L7981,m7
 What?," When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.", L7984, L7983,m7
 What is it?, Oh God!  He killed them!, L8065, L8064,m7
 Now you know who and what Freddy really is., I though Freddy was just an old town story., L8105, L8104,m7
 I'll tell you later., It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream., L8116, L8115,m7
" It's okay, babe.  We're with you.", I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed., L8118, L8117,m7
 Feeling better now?, Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?, L8067, L8066,m7
 I gotta get out of here., You just stay put.  You need rest., L8070, L8069,m7
" You don't get it, he's after me..."," Don't worry, honey", L8072, L8071,m7
" Excuse us, dear."," It's okay, Dan", L8420, L8419,m8
" Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?"," What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.", L8718, L8717,m8
" Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.", And ours.  It's our grandchild., L8722, L8721,m8
" In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --"," What are you talking about?  My ""condition""?...", L8725, L8724,m8
 We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here., You're not taking my baby!, L8729, L8728,m8
 Hey...wake up., Huh?, L8536, L8535,m8
" Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?"," It's lonely in there, in my room.", L8539, L8538,m8
 I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed., How did you know that?, L8542, L8541,m8
" Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?", Been having bad dreams., L8645, L8644,m8
 Is that who you're waiting for?, No..., L8649, L8648,m8
 I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom., She doesn't want me around, L8651, L8650,m8
 No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?," Who said I...wait, what?", L8654, L8653,m8
 Who says I don't like you?," My friend, with the funny hand.", L8657, L8656,m8
 Mommy...?, Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both., L8793, L8792,m8
 Where is he?," He's inside you, where he hides.", L8802, L8801,m8
 What do you mean?, It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me., L8804, L8803,m8
 But how...?, He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people., L8806, L8805,m8
" Hi, beautiful.", Jesus!  Don't do that!, L8396, L8395,m8
 The tickets.," They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!", L8401, L8400,m8
" Okay, babe.  What's the matter?", Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony., L8404, L8403,m8
 About him?," No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.", L8408, L8407,m8
 You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream., Yeah...I guess., L8410, L8409,m8
" You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...", You're right., L8412, L8411,m8
 There you go.  Love you., Me too., L8414, L8413,m8
 I was afraid you weren't coming.," I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing...", L8440, L8439,m8
 That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings., No.  A deal's a deal., L8442, L8441,m8
 Dad!, It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip., L8444, L8443,m8
 Where are we going?, To take a picture., L8447, L8446,m8
" Thanks for everything, Dad.", You sure you don't want a ride to work?, L8450, L8449,m8
" I'm so sorry, honey..."," Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.", L8525, L8524,m8
 How was the meeting?, Sobering..., L8574, L8573,m8
 Very funny., Alice..., L8576, L8575,m8
 Since when are you such a smart shopper?, Since my little girl became a mom..., L8578, L8577,m8
 You disappointed in me?," No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.", L8580, L8579,m8
 Alice!, I've got to go., L8780, L8779,m8
 No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home., But Dad --, L8782, L8781,m8
" Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.", Had kind of a long night., L8363, L8362,m8
" Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl."," No, the Dan part was nice...", L8365, L8364,m8
" Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan."," Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.", L8394, L8393,m8
" It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way."," Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.", L8523, L8522,m8
" Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?", There aren't any little boys on your floor., L8546, L8545,m8
 Did everyone call everyone?, They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me., L8552, L8551,m8
 What's that got to do with it?, When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story., L8565, L8564,m8
 It was just an accident.  Like with Dan., No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger., L8614, L8613,m8
" I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?", Why don't you two stick to reality., L8621, L8620,m8
 You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?, I think Krueger's trying to do something to it., L8673, L8672,m8
" Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...", Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands., L8675, L8674,m8
" I really think you need to calm down now, okay?", I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake..., L8677, L8676,m8
" I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.", Krueger is reality., L8696, L8695,m8
 And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!," What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??", L8698, L8697,m8
 All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?," Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.", L8700, L8699,m8
 Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night..., That's the only reason you're alive..., L8705, L8704,m8
 Are you alright?, Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy., L8760, L8759,m8
 You think that's the place she's buried?, If they actually bothered to bury her., L8770, L8769,m8
 What?, Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late., L8776, L8775,m8
 But how are we gonna --, We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!, L8778, L8777,m8
" You do good work, Alice.", So did Dan., L8817, L8816,m8
 He sure loves to stay awake., That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep., L8819, L8818,m8
" Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.", I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway., L8377, L8376,m8
 Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.," Greta, come on.  One burger with me?", L8383, L8382,m8
 My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house., Well we gotta do something!, L8424, L8423,m8
 I've got to write some of this down., That's why it's my fault Dan's dead., L8557, L8556,m8
" Mark, are you okay?", Yeah.  I'm just aces., L8610, L8609,m8
 I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...," I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?", L8612, L8611,m8
 I thought about that., She must've fallen asleep at the table..., L8617, L8616,m8
 Then get out!, Mark!, L8627, L8626,m8
 Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?, Nobody thinks that., L8634, L8633,m8
" Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.", It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party., L8638, L8637,m8
 Tell me some more about this Krueger guy., Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell., L8640, L8639,m8
 Who's Jacob?, My baby!, L8664, L8663,m8
" Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?", I don't know!, L8668, L8667,m8
 Where are you going?, I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger, L8671, L8670,m8
" I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.", Then we'll find another way., L8711, L8710,m8
 They think I'm nuts., That's their problem., L8733, L8732,m8
" No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?"," That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.", L8735, L8734,m8
 They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business., But I've seen her grave., L8738, L8737,m8
 Poor woman..., No shit., L8741, L8740,m8
 I don't understand., She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment., L8743, L8742,m8
" Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?"," Next life.  Oh, what's that?", L8374, L8373,m8
 Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!," Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.", L8381, L8380,m8
" That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.", You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?, L8422, L8421,m8
 He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes., Who?, L8489, L8488,m8
 Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that., I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?, L8495, L8494,m8
 These things are wild...  What do you think?, Makes you look like a nun--, L8367, L8366,m8
" All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...", Yeah..., L8426, L8425,m8
" Have another one, sounds like you need it."," Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?", L8483, L8482,m8
" Stop saying that, it's bullshit.", I want to talk about the baby., L8559, L8558,m8
 Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are., Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy., L8563, L8562,m8
" Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.", All of us.  Right?, L8571, L8570,m8
 Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.," Two hours a day, six days a week.", L8481, L8480,m8
 Vomit?, Faint., L8499, L8498,m8
" Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!", Mark..., L8623, L8622,m8
" I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!", I can't listen to this., L8625, L8624,m8
 It's okay.," Stick around, please?", L8630, L8629,m8
" You, too?", He invited me to his house last night., L8703, L8702,m8
" Great, great. That's fantastic.", It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost., L84021, L84020,m30
 Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star., That's great., L84024, L84023,m30
 See! The big guy likes it.," I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.", L84029, L84028,m30
 Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives., I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone., L84031, L84030,m30
" Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?", Yes!, L84033, L84032,m30
 I know her uncle. Friends of the family., Who is she? Where does she live?, L84035, L84034,m30
 What do you mean? You don't even know me.," Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.", L84038, L84037,m30
 Someone stole my backpack.," Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.", L84041, L84040,m30
" I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet."," Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.", L84044, L84043,m30
" Didn't kill anything, did I?"," A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.", L84061, L84060,m30
" I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.", There's only one I want., L84064, L84063,m30
" Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.", Thank you., L84066, L84065,m30
 Welcome to ya. What's your name?, Edward Bloom., L83881, L83880,m30
 Bloom like a flower?, Yes., L83883, L83882,m30
 You were expecting me?, Not yet., L83886, L83885,m30
 What is this place?," The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.", L83893, L83892,m30
 The poet? What ever happened to him?," He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.", L83895, L83894,m30
 Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate., It truly is., L83899, L83898,m30
 I have to leave. Tonight., Why?, L83937, L83936,m30
" This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.", No one's ever left., L83939, L83938,m30
 You won't find a better place!, I don't expect to., L83943, L83942,m30
 Or are you too scared?, I'll go in right now and get that eye., L83729, L83728,m30
 Then do it.," Fine, I will.", L83731, L83730,m30
" Fine, you do it."," Fine, I'm doing it.", L83733, L83732,m30
 You get the eye?, I brought it., L83738, L83737,m30
 Bloom!, Don., L84091, L84090,m30
 What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!, I didn't know she belonged to anybody., L84093, L84092,m30
 Will.," Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.", L83766, L83765,m30
 Can I see him?, Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him., L83774, L83773,m30
" Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.", My father and I have an advantage. We never talk., L84355, L84354,m30
 How long have you known my father?, Thirty years. Maybe more., L84357, L84356,m30
 How would you describe him?, Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?, L84359, L84358,m30
 Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?, A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish., L84361, L84360,m30
 Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?, No., L84363, L84362,m30
 Did you see that woman?, What did she look like?, L83920, L83919,m30
" Well, she... uh...", Was she nekkid?, L83922, L83921,m30
 Yeah.," It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.", L83924, L83923,m30
 How old are you?, Eighteen., L83928, L83927,m30
" I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.", You're pretty good at arithmetic., L83930, L83929,m30
 How are you gonna make it without your shoes?, I suspect it will hurt a lot., L83941, L83940,m30
 Promise me you'll come back., I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to., L83945, L83944,m30
 You must be Edward Bloom., How did you know?, L84283, L84282,m30
 No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.," Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.", L84285, L84284,m30
 So I've heard.," I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.", L84287, L84286,m30
" In so many words, yes."," Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.", L84290, L84289,m30
 Helping people makes me happy., I'm not convinced you should be happy., L84294, L84293,m30
 You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married., I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference., L84298, L84297,m30
" I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.", I see. I thank you for your time., L84300, L84299,m30
" It's okay, just leave it.", I can get it. I can just..., L84303, L84302,m30
" Lord, I'm sorry I...", Please. Go. Just go., L84305, L84304,m30
 I'll..., Go., L84307, L84306,m30
 Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife., I know., L84315, L84314,m30
" And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.", Lucky girl., L84317, L84316,m30
 Really.," You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.", L83958, L83957,m30
 Hi. How are you feeling?, I was dreaming., L83986, L83985,m30
" Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, ""Your Aunt is going to die."" I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.", That's terrible., L83990, L83989,m30
" Because see, my mother was banging the milkman."," No, I understand.", L83994, L83993,m30
 He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box., Stop., L83998, L83997,m30
 Spooning the sherbet., Can I take your picture?, L84002, L84001,m30
 You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary., Please?, L84004, L84003,m30
 That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else., I never knew., L84008, L84007,m30
 Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.," Oh, so this is a tall tale?", L84010, L84009,m30
 I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.," Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.", L84108, L84107,m30
 Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?," Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.", L84110, L84109,m30
 There was one time when I was eleven..., You were talking about your wedding., L84112, L84111,m30
" I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.", I like your stories., L84114, L84113,m30
" Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.", Really?, L83849, L83848,m30
" Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?", I can., L83851, L83850,m30
" You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here."," What's your name, Giant?", L83854, L83853,m30
 Karl.," Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.", L83856, L83855,m30
 You don't like it?, I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?, L83858, L83857,m30
 Okay., Okay., L83860, L83859,m30
 What did she say?, Beats me., L83869, L83868,m30
 You know anyone's who's taken it?," That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.", L83873, L83872,m30
 You're not trying to run away?," Just to be sure, you can take my pack.", L83875, L83874,m30
" You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.", Make him stop., L83659, L83658,m30
" What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?", I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born., L83671, L83670,m30
 Jesus Christ., Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?, L83673, L83672,m30
" Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story."," No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?", L83675, L83674,m30
 The one about the witch., Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares., L83704, L83703,m30
 You --  -- are in for a surprise., Am I?, L83778, L83777,m30
" Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...", Did you do any of that?, L83780, L83779,m30
" No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.", You think I'm up for it?, L83782, L83781,m30
 People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go., Really., L83786, L83785,m30
 Truly. I saw it in The Eye., The Old Lady by the swamp., L83788, L83787,m30
 She was a witch.," No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.", L83790, L83789,m30
 I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens., So how does it happen?, L83792, L83791,m30
 There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office., Okay., L83795, L83794,m30
" And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?", What did he say?, L83797, L83796,m30
 You owe me three-fifty., Really., L83799, L83798,m30
 When did you ever work in an office?, There's a lot you don't know about me., L83802, L83801,m30

 You know where the chemicals are?," I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.", L83811, L83810,m30
 I thought you weren't dying., I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that., L83814, L83813,m30
" Why not religion, Dad?", It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend., L83960, L83959,m30
 Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.," Oh, so you know.", L83962, L83961,m30
 Did I ever tell you about how..., Yes., L84166, L84165,m30
 The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it., I think someone hasn't., L84168, L84167,m30
 But the real story is how I got the car. You see..., Dad?, L84171, L84170,m30
 Son?, Can we talk?, L84173, L84172,m30
" Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?"," Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.", L84177, L84176,m30
 Dad!, What?, L84179, L84178,m30
 I'm trying to make a metaphor here.," Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, ""The thing about icebergs is...""", L84181, L84180,m30
 The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.," What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?", L84183, L84182,m30

" You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.", You think I'm fake., L84187, L84186,m30
" Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me."," It would kill you, huh?", L84190, L84189,m30

 Daffodils?, They're your favorite flower., L84082, L84081,m30
 How did you get so many?, I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me., L84084, L84083,m30
 You don't even know me., I have the rest of my life to find out., L84086, L84085,m30
 How can I convince you to stop?, Go out with me., L84104, L84103,m30
 I was drying out., I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern., L84239, L84238,m30
 Wait! I need those!, There is no softer ground than town., L83903, L83902,m30
 I've been working on this poem for 12 years., Really., L83909, L83908,m30
 This is why you don't show work in progress.," Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?", L83913, L83912,m30

 It's me. Norther Winslow., I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas., L84213, L84212,m30
 I don't believe it!," I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.", L84215, L84214,m30
 So what are you up to now?, I'm robbing this place., L84218, L84217,m30

 Were you and my father having an affair?," Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.", L84262, L84261,m30
" Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?", Because he's dying., L84265, L84264,m30
" Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game."," My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.", L84267, L84266,m30
" Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young."," No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.", L84324, L84323,m30
 You didn't become crazy.," Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.", L84326, L84325,m30

 It's bad., It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo., L83696, L83695,m30
 You need to go., Probably tonight., L83698, L83697,m30
 I'm going with you., You don't have to., L83700, L83699,m30
 I talked with your father last night., Did you?, L84146, L84145,m30
 You never told me how your parents met., They met at Auburn., L84148, L84147,m30
 What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that., That's because most of it never happened., L84150, L84149,m30
 Mmm.," Mmm, what?", L84153, L84152,m30
 Do you love your father?, Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy., L84156, L84155,m30
" You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.", But it's not true., L84159, L84158,m30

 Is that Dr. Bennett's car?, He's up with your father., L83760, L83759,m30

 Would you say you understand Josephine?, Yes. But that's a different..., L83970, L83969,m30
 Josephine and I have a lot in common.," Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.", L83973, L83972,m30
" I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all."," But I understand you, Mom. I always have.", L83976, L83975,m30
" Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important."," Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.", L83979, L83978,m30

 Mom?, Yes?, L84245, L84244,m30
 Did you and Dad have any other property?, I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it., L84247, L84246,m30
 So you never bought any land., Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place., L84249, L84248,m30
" I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.", I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight., L84340, L84339,m30

 Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work., That's insane., L282624, L282623,m89
 Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance., Of bodies., L282626, L282625,m89

 You have a gift.  One you must protect., And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?, L282306, L282305,m89

" You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders."," Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.", L282311, L282310,m89

 It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.

In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.

 State of grace and all that., Tradition., L282488, L282487,m89
 Not so scared., Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck., L282492, L282491,m89
 No doubt., You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion., L282494, L282493,m89

 Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now., No., L282508, L282507,m89

" Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!", Dad was onto something here!, L299384, L299383,m98

" The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. ""Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.""  But where exactly?", Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map., L299468, L299467,m98
" Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon.

 Are you expected?," Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.", L299507, L299506,m98
 Tapestries?," Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?", L299509, L299508,m98

 My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan., I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive., L299293, L299292,m98
" Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.", That was our assessment as well., L299296, L299295,m98
 Where did this come from?, My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?, L299298, L299297,m98
" ""Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."""," The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.", L299302, L299301,m98

 An old man's dream.," Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.", L299306, L299305,m98
" Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!"," What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.", L299311, L299310,m98
" Let me tell you another ""bedtime story,"" Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact."," I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.", L299314, L299313,m98
" This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two ""markers"" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those ""markers."" It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second ""marker"" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.", That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet., L299317, L299316,m98
 You could be more right than you know., Yes?, L299319, L299318,m98
" We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail."," You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?", L299321, L299320,m98
 DONOVAN!," Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?", L299602, L299601,m98
" Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?", As what? A Nazi stooge like you?, L299915, L299914,m98
" Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.", Shooting me won't get you anywhere., L299917, L299916,m98

 And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you., Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for., L299356, L299355,m98
 The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.," Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!", L299362, L299361,m98
 Fraulein -- will you permit me?, I usually don't., L299364, L299363,m98
 I usually don't either.," In that case, I permit you.", L299366, L299365,m98
 It would make me very happy., But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded., L299368, L299367,m98
" My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.", Find something?, L299387, L299386,m98

 What's that?, It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet., L299426, L299425,m98

" Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.", What does she want from me?, L345791, L345790,m118
 Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.," It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...", L345794, L345793,m118
 Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?," Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --", L345796, L345795,m118
 Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?, Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --, L345798, L345797,m118
" But... but, why?"," Big question that, lad.  Why what?", L345802, L345801,m118
" Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?", Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer., L345804, L345803,m118
 Don't you know?," If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...", L345806, L345805,m118
" That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers."," Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?", L345809, L345808,m118
" If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.", Don't you care about what's happened?, L345811, L345810,m118
" Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night", There must be an answer somewhere., L345813, L345812,m118
" True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.", Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?, L345815, L345814,m118
" Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards", How is it this hag knows the truth?, L345817, L345816,m118
" Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.", Will you lead me to her?, L345819, L345818,m118
 Are we here?, Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child., L345823, L345822,m118
 What do I do?," Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.", L345825, L345824,m118
 Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle., And if she thinks me a liar?, L345827, L345826,m118
 The princess is dead.," Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.", L345877, L345876,m118
 Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it., Aye.  Black Baron's mischief., L345879, L345878,m118
 If the horn be restored the curse is ended.," Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?", L345881, L345880,m118
" I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!"," Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.", L345883, L345882,m118
" Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?", I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter., L345885, L345884,m118
" There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep."," Have we turned grave-robber, then?", L345887, L345886,m118
" A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.", And who might that be?, L345889, L345888,m118
" So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?"," Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...", L345892, L345891,m118
" Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.", You do the praying.  I've work ahead., L345895, L345894,m118
" There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.", What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?, L345897, L345896,m118
" There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.", Better we eat him than the other way round., L345938, L345937,m118
 By the grace of God.," No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.", L345943, L345942,m118
 I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.," Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor", L345947, L345946,m118
 Shhhh!, Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad., L345955, L345954,m118
 What is it?, Something's coming., L345965, L345964,m118
" Pregnant, is she?", It would appear so., L345969, L345968,m118
 Damn them!," Careful, lad.", L345975, L345974,m118
" Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!", The colt's still too small., L345996, L345995,m118
 I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?," We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.", L345998, L345997,m118
" Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.", Save your mischief for the Black Baron., L346000, L345999,m118
 Aye!  That too., You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart., L346002, L346001,m118
 I'll drop a cow on the knave!, Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops., L346004, L346003,m118
 Fine-looking army., We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour., L346006, L346005,m118
" How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?"," A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.", L346008, L346007,m118
 Track the demon to his lair., Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying., L346010, L346009,m118
 We must follow that bird., Whatever for?, L346016, L346015,m118
" Jenny Greenteeth said:  ""Follow the raven in her flight...""", Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?, L346018, L346017,m118
 I'm sure.  It spoke to me., Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?, L346020, L346019,m118
 Beware.," Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!", L346022, L346021,m118
 How do we follow a raven we can't even see?, Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes., L346035, L346034,m118
 This is ogre's magic., Blackheart?, L346052, L346051,m118
 Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.," Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.", L346054, L346053,m118
 The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.," Jack, don't!", L346056, L346055,m118
 Worse than the battlefield., What know you of fields of war?, L346061, L346060,m118
 There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing., Well... if the knight be already dead, L346064, L346063,m118
 Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance., That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods., L346070, L346069,m118
 Good.," Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.", L346074, L346073,m118
 Twould appear other travelers precede us.," Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.", L346076, L346075,m118
 I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.," Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.", L346078, L346077,m118
 And this?  Some of their handiwork?, Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly., L346080, L346079,m118
 Better to kill than be disturbed.," Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.", L346082, L346081,m118
 Nice piece of work., Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time., L346089, L346088,m118
 My God!  Look!, Something the matter?, L346107, L346106,m118
" Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.", Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet., L346110, L346109,m118
 Certainly understandable.," Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.", L346112, L346111,m118
 I should hope not!," Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.", L346116, L346115,m118
 I pray always to be worthy of it.," Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.", L346134, L346133,m118
" Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck."," We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...", L346137, L346136,m118
" Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack."," God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.", L346139, L346138,m118
 Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.," Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.", L346230, L346229,m118
 ... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress..., We'll surely be in our graves if we don't., L346243, L346242,m118
 God's blessing.," There's the way, mates.", L346247, L346246,m118
" What make ye of that, Jack?", It bodes evil., L346249, L346248,m118
 Wait!," Willful creature, that one...", L346256, L346255,m118
 Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...," Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.", L346262, L346261,m118
 Is she... dead?," No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.", L346268, L346267,m118
 We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?, We'll find it., L346270, L346269,m118
 Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago., Heading true north.  We continue in that direction., L346272, L346271,m118
 Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.," We'll trust in faith, Gump.", L346274, L346273,m118
" Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely."," Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...", L346285, L346284,m118
 We'll never find the Baron's castle.," Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.", L346287, L346286,m118
" Wait, Jack.", Nay.  This time we strike first!, L346290, L346289,m118
" Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!", Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends., L346295, L346294,m118
 Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --, But seem to have gotten lost on the way., L346305, L346304,m118
 Can we trust him?, No... but what choice have we?, L346324, L346323,m118
 Never felt so cold in all me born days..., The chill is worse this night., L346352, L346351,m118
" Don't like the feel of it, Jack."," It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.", L346357, L346356,m118
 Give in to despair and all is lost.," It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.", L346361, L346360,m118
 There's more than one way to spring a trap.," Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.", L346363, L346362,m118
" That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.", On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true., L346369, L346368,m118
 Tells you something 'bout him what lives there..., We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders., L346373, L346372,m118
 Why not mine the damned walls?, We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under..., L346375, L346374,m118
" A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?", Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already., L346400, L346399,m118
 Easily spoken..., Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly., L346402, L346401,m118
 There aren't enough arrows., Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow., L346404, L346403,m118
 Water doesn't burn...," And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.", L346428, L346427,m118
 There isn't much time!," Been telling you that all along, lad.", L346430, L346429,m118
 What magic have we on our side?," Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --", L346432, L346431,m118
" That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.", Will you chance a miss?, L346434, L346433,m118
 One more turn..., That's it!, L346450, L346449,m118
 Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?, Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked., L346452, L346451,m118
" Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.", Fire away!, L346454, L346453,m118
 He'll be atop the portculis ere long.," Best get down close to the moat, lad.", L346463, L346462,m118
 Aye.  We're good as inside., It's what we'll find there worries me., L346465, L346464,m118
" Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.", It doesn't matter., L346520, L346519,m118
 Nonsense!  Course it matters., ... the Princess Lili... I've killed her., L346522, L346521,m118
" She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.", The wound is mortal., L346524, L346523,m118
 Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine., Can you save her?, L346526, L346525,m118
" Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.", I don't... understand., L346528, L346527,m118
" The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock..."," In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?", L346531, L346530,m118
" Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key."," Sunlight, you say?", L346533, L346532,m118
" Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!", Mean you to seek him out below?, L346535, L346534,m118
 I'm not afraid of the dark.," I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.", L346537, L346536,m118
" The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.", Did you bring me here to sup?, L346540, L346539,m118
" Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.", What weapon?, L346542, L346541,m118
 Sunlight., Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?, L346544, L346543,m118
 Will you explain what's going on?," Patience, lad.", L346550, L346549,m118
 Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.," Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.", L346552, L346551,m118
 Can't we move any faster?," Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!", L346557, L346556,m118
 Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead..., Don't get too far!, L346561, L346560,m118

" Not in the mood, I'm afraid.", Listen to him.  Not in the mood..., L346601, L346600,m118
 On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --, I'm not denying it's a joyous day --, L346603, L346602,m118
 Where's your joy if you cannot sing?, Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!, L346605, L346604,m118
 She lives... isn't that worth singing about?," She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...", L346607, L346606,m118
 The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?," Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell", L346612, L346611,m118
 I'll do anything... face any challenge!, Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?, L346614, L346613,m118
 I was with the Princess., Where?, L346616, L346615,m118
 By the pond.  She was teasing me., Go on... go on..., L346618, L346617,m118
 She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did., And did you?, L346620, L346619,m118
 Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over., That's it then... the ring!, L346622, L346621,m118
 You must find the ring... It completes the cycle, I'll try., L346624, L346623,m118

 Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!, Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night., L346072, L346071,m118

" Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.", Are you honest?, L345692, L345691,m118

 I see.," Well, it's a good morning, anyway.", L357006, L357005,m124
" Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?"," Why, of course. Yes.", L357009, L357008,m124
" Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.", That's ridiculous., L357011, L357010,m124
 Is it?, It certainly is., L357013, L357012,m124
 Look hereù," Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the southù", L357015, L357014,m124
 I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.," Oh, really?", L357017, L357016,m124

" Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.", Now you're irritating and absurd!, L357021, L357020,m124
 He might have lost his way., Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises., L357028, L357027,m124
 Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?, Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?, L357042, L357041,m124
 Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!," All right, all right. Keep quiet.", L357124, L357123,m124
 Where are they? Do you see them?, Yes!, L357142, L357141,m124
" Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.", Will you stop squawking!, L357166, L357165,m124
 Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.," You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.", L357168, L357167,m124
 Something tells me this means food. Come on!, I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner., L357170, L357169,m124
" Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.", That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them., L357172, L357171,m124
" Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.", Please don't call me Lovey., L357174, L357173,m124
 Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.," All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.", L357177, L357176,m124

 How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge., I'm thinking., L357236, L357235,m124
 Thinking? What about some double solitaire?," As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.", L357238, L357237,m124

" And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again.

 Have I?," It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!", L357362, L357361,m124
 Certainly not.," Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.", L357366, L357365,m124
 The police?, Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?, L357368, L357367,m124
 That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!," colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of peopleù", L357375, L357374,m124
" You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had."," You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.", L357377, L357376,m124

 Yeah. You know., Horns? What kind of horns?, L357506, L357505,m124
" Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.", So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me., L357513, L357512,m124
 You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!, And be poisoned out here in the open?, L357515, L357514,m124

" It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?", I'll say., L357181, L357180,m124
 That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.," Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.", L357234, L357233,m124

 Yeah. I though you ran this joint.," Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?", L357404, L357403,m124
" You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?", It's unbelievable., L357584, L357583,m124
 Think of it! In times like these.," Say, what about that gold deal?", L357586, L357585,m124
 Huh?, Gold. You were going toù, L357588, L357587,m124

" Hey, what's happened to you?", Nothing. Why?, L357355, L357354,m124
" Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.", Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?, L357630, L357629,m124
 If you want me to!, Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you., L357645, L357644,m124

 Hey - look!," Look, Bob!", L357140, L357139,m124
" There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.", Leaving?, L357633, L357632,m124
" Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!", When are you going to start?, L357635, L357634,m124
 Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along., I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip., L357637, L357636,m124
 You mean you don't want to go?, Well - I'mù, L357639, L357638,m124
" I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?"," Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing businessù", L357641, L357640,m124
" All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?"," Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?", L357643, L357642,m124
 And mine's Conway., How do you do?, L357149, L357148,m124
 Where is your mad pilot?," He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.", L357154, L357153,m124
" You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.", Thank you., L357160, L357159,m124
 And the wine - excellent., I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley., L357203, L357202,m124
" It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.", Who and what is Shangri-La? You?, L357266, L357265,m124
" Goodness, no!", So there are others?, L357268, L357267,m124
" Oh, yes."," Who, for instance?", L357270, L357269,m124
" For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be."," There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.", L357273, L357272,m124
" You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.", Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures., L357275, L357274,m124
" By the way, what religion do you follow here?", We follow many., L357283, L357282,m124
" To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even includingù  ùthe excess of virtue itself.", That's intelligent., L357285, L357284,m124
" We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.", How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?, L357287, L357286,m124
" Oh, good heavens, no!", How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?, L357289, L357288,m124
" Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.", You have no disputes over women?, L357291, L357290,m124
" Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.", Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?, L357293, L357292,m124
" Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.", That's very convenient. I think I'd like that., L357295, L357294,m124
" But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?", They were., L357300, L357299,m124
" Well, it must have takenû", Centuries., L357302, L357301,m124
 Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?," Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.", L357304, L357303,m124
 That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?," Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .", L357306, L357305,m124
 ùbuy and sell?," Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .", L357308, L357307,m124
" I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?"," That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.", L357310, L357309,m124
 Who?," A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.", L357312, L357311,m124
 When was all this?," Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.", L357314, L357313,m124
 He amputated his own leg?," Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.", L357316, L357315,m124
" Well, they didn't actually mean that."," Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.", L357318, L357317,m124
" Well, is it?"," Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?", L357320, L357319,m124
 108 and still active?, You're startled?, L357322, L357321,m124
" Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all."," Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, ""He worried himself to death?"" or, ""This thing or that killed him?""", L357324, L357323,m124
 Very often.," And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.", L357326, L357325,m124
" That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course."," Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!", L357328, L357327,m124
 I surprise you? Now that's news.," I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?", L357330, L357329,m124
" Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course."," Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?", L357332, L357331,m124
 One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?, The only one., L357410, L357409,m124
 And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?," The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.", L357412, L357411,m124
 Yes. I'm afraid it does., Shall we have another?, L357597, L357596,m124
" Charming, isn't she?"," Yes, charming.", L357602, L357601,m124
 Your brother seems quite fascinated by her., Why not? She's an attractive young woman., L357604, L357603,m124
 Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people., Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?, L357606, L357605,m124
 Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely., Suppose she should leave it?, L357608, L357607,m124
 Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.," No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?", L357610, L357609,m124
" Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age."," It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?", L357612, L357611,m124
 You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive., I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!, L357619, L357618,m124
 What do you want?, I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-, L357184, L357183,m124
 Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do., I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!, L357187, L357186,m124
" I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.", No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine., L357189, L357188,m124
 Please let me help you.," Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!", L357191, L357190,m124
 You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?," Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!", L357193, L357192,m124
" Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason."," I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.", L357214, L357213,m124
 No porters here!!, No., L357216, L357215,m124
" What exactly do you mean by ""almost any time now""?"," Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.", L357224, L357223,m124
" You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.", The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!, L357402, L357401,m124
" Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.", Yes., L357566, L357565,m124
" You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]", You've very kind Mr. Lovett., L357568, L357567,m124
" I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story."," Oh, I'm so glad.", L357570, L357569,m124
" Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, ""Lovey""ù  Mr. Lovett! ""Mr. Lovett,"" I said, ""you are an ungrateful fool . . . """," Why, no.", L357572, L357571,m124
" ""Ungrateful fool . . . !""  Those were my very words to myself last night. ""Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."""," Now, what would you like to do?", L357574, L357573,m124
" Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.", Splendid!, L357576, L357575,m124
 Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one., I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?, L357578, L357577,m124
" Oh, immediately.", Then it's done., L357580, L357579,m124
" Oh, thank you. Thank you!", Thank you., L357582, L357581,m124
 We were just going to bury him when you came along., Pardon meù, L357156, L357155,m124
" In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.", Are you so certain you are away from it?, L357210, L357209,m124
 As far away as I ever want to be.," Oh, dear.", L357212, L357211,m124
" Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.", How can we get in touch with them?, L357221, L357220,m124
 The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.," Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.", L357406, L357405,m124
" A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!"," Now, my dear boy. You shouldn'tù", L357616, L357615,m124
 It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?, Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?, L357721, L357720,m124
" I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!", I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone., L357723, L357722,m124
" The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!", Father Perrault is dead., L357725, L357724,m124
" He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!"," Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?", L357727, L357726,m124
" Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?", Yes., L357729, L357728,m124
" You're lying, aren't you?"," No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.", L357734, L357733,m124
 Are you taking me?," Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!", L357743, L357742,m124

" Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all."," Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?", L357432, L357431,m124
" We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on."," But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless.

 What is it?, See that spot?, L357104, L357103,m124
 Yes., That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map., L357106, L357105,m124
 What's it mean?, It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached., L357108, L357107,m124

" George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?", Chang's first question was about the pilot., L357261, L357260,m124
 Uh-huh.," There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?", L357263, L357262,m124

 Thank you.," Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.", L357480, L357479,m124

 I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?," On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.", L357491, L357490,m124
 I'm so glad.," I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?", L357493, L357492,m124

 Nice.," I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear.

Hope your time here will be a happy one.", L439499, L439498,m158
 The one that goes into the woods--sure., That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there., L439501, L439500,m158
 You folks ready to go on?, Sure., L439510, L439509,m158
 Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?, Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands., L439514, L439513,m158

Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!", L439536, L439535,m158

" I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception."," What did we do, Jud?", L439721, L439720,m158
 I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But..., Wouldn't wash?, L439724, L439723,m158
" No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?", Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself., L439726, L439725,m158
 Can I have another one?, I guess it wouldn't hurt., L439728, L439727,m158

" Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.", This babe has said enough., L439774, L439773,m158
" Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust.

 No.  The pirates have taken Will --, Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy., L442293, L442292,m159

 You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard., Then I can wear men's clothing., L442307, L442306,m159
 That would hardly be proper.," Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!", L442309, L442308,m159
" Actually, I find it all fascinating."," And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?", L441601, L441600,m159
 Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?, Yes -- yes., L441625, L441624,m159
 It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?, Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?, L441629, L441628,m159
 Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today., Ceremony?, L441631, L441630,m159
 I knew it.," Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.", L441634, L441633,m159

 But ... you did it before!  Last time --," Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.", L442244, L442243,m159
 So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?," Welcome to the Caribbean, love.", L442246, L442245,m159
" You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.", A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!, L442248, L442247,m159
" Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about."," Not when you can drink instead, at least.", L442251, L442250,m159
" Drink up me hearties, yo ho ..."," What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.", L442255, L442254,m159
 Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.," I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.", L442257, L442256,m159
" That was before I met one, of course.", Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it., L442260, L442259,m159
" Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...", More to drink!, L442262, L442261,m159
" When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!", You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main., L442269, L442268,m159
" Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again."," Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.", L442272, L442271,m159
 Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk., We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs., L442274, L442273,m159

" What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!"," Yes, the rum is gone.", L442278, L442277,m159
 Why?," One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --", L442280, L442279,m159
" That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?"," You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?", L442282, L442281,m159
 You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.," Nor did you, I noticed.", L442319, L442318,m159
 He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late., Exactly., L442321, L442320,m159
 These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.," I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.", L442323, L442322,m159
" Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!"," Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.", L442024, L442023,m159
" Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?", First -- have you found me a crew?, L442030, L442029,m159
" Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx."," Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?", L442032, L442031,m159
 Say again?," I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.", L442035, L442034,m159
" Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl."," Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.", L442037, L442036,m159
 A fool's errand., Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs., L442039, L442038,m159
" Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?", That he is., L442044, L442043,m159
" We'd best drop canvas, sir!", She can hold a bit longer., L442057, L442056,m159
 What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?, We're catching up!, L442059, L442058,m159
 How did you get off the island?," Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.", L442078, L442077,m159
" Blast it, I'm already awake!", I know.  That was for the smell., L442027, L442026,m159
 How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?," Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.", L442068, L442067,m159
" I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --", What?  He never told me that., L442071, L442070,m159

" Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.", Okay... what about Strickland?, L551268, L551267,m200
" He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.", What do you mean?, L551316, L551315,m200
 Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.," This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?", L551318, L551317,m200
 2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her., I intend to., L551321, L551320,m200
" No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.", Only way I could stand your ties., L551392, L551391,m200
 I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice., Where's Faith?, L551394, L551393,m200
 I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran., What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?, L551396, L551395,m200
 You just did., Jesus!, L551398, L551397,m200
" So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.", That's pretty much the way it happened., L551401, L551400,m200
" Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?", That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy., L551403, L551402,m200
 Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?, You bet.  Did you like it?, L551405, L551404,m200
 Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect., I won't say anything., L551408, L551407,m200
" Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times."," And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.", L551411, L551410,m200
" No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway."," You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.", L551413, L551412,m200
 So there never was a death squad., Naawww., L551417, L551416,m200
 Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.," Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.", L551419, L551418,m200
 How did you hook up with Faith?," This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...", L551421, L551420,m200
" Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny."," Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.", L550671, L550670,m200
 How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?, With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig., L550674, L550673,m200
" Yeah, but how'd it get to you?"," I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?", L550676, L550675,m200
" Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.", Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black., L550678, L550677,m200
 I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.," Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.", L550680, L550679,m200
 So lay it off to somebody else.," Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...", L550682, L550681,m200
" Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'."," Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.", L550684, L550683,m200
" Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'."," Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'", L550687, L550686,m200
" I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.", Ha!  That's for fucking sure., L550689, L550688,m200
 Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.," Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.", L551142, L551141,m200
" Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...", What?, L551147, L551146,m200
" Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.", Who was just here?, L551149, L551148,m200
" Iris, man.  Pay attention."," Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!", L551151, L551150,m200
" Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.", What clip?  What was it?, L551153, L551152,m200
" I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'", She never gave me a tape., L551155, L551154,m200
" You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?"," You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.", L550917, L550916,m200
" Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist."," Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.", L550922, L550921,m200
 I always do.," Faith, can I talk to you a second?", L550924, L550923,m200
 About what?," That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?", L550928, L550927,m200
 Charm.," Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?", L551053, L551052,m200
 It's alright.  He means it., I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?, L551055, L551054,m200
 Nero., Strickland., L550866, L550865,m200
 Commissioner Strickland.," Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.", L550868, L550867,m200
 Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?," I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.", L550870, L550869,m200
" I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?", Your sex life?, L550872, L550871,m200
" Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story."," They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?", L550820, L550819,m200
" Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--"," Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.", L550834, L550833,m200
" Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.", Sleaze to peddle., L550836, L550835,m200
 Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--, Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?, L550838, L550837,m200
" Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight."," Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.", L550840, L550839,m200
" Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.", Mace!  You're a life-saver., L550842, L550841,m200
" So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?"," No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.", L550845, L550844,m200
 Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.," Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.", L550847, L550846,m200
" Uh huh, I wanna hear this part."," Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--", L550849, L550848,m200
 Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.," Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.", L550851, L550850,m200
" Lenny, this shit's illegal.", Define illegal., L550853, L550852,m200
 Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.," Yeah, but that was for love.", L550855, L550854,m200
 What's his name?, Fumitsu., L550859, L550858,m200
 What the fuck are you doing?, Coming with you., L550863, L550862,m200
 Are we having a bad night?, Let's talk in the car., L550876, L550875,m200
" Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?"," I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.", L550883, L550882,m200
 I need my case.  It's still in the back., Get it., L550887, L550886,m200
 That would be no.," I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.", L550890, L550889,m200
 I thought we were friends.," No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.", L550893, L550892,m200
 So am I.  Just trying to get by.," No, you're just trying to get off.", L550895, L550894,m200
 Macey... I've never seen you like this.," Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.", L550897, L550896,m200
" I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really."," Look, I gotta get some sleep.", L550899, L550898,m200

" Jesus, Lenny."," Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.", L550904, L550903,m200
 Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?, Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97., L550908, L550907,m200
 Forget her., She still loves me., L550911, L550910,m200
 She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this., She's my destiny., L550913, L550912,m200
 Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride., You'll see., L550915, L550914,m200
" You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you.

 What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.," It is my sword and my shield, Macey.", L550993, L550992,m200
 What's that?  Present from Faith?, No idea., L550995, L550994,m200
 What is it?, Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!, L551000, L550999,m200
" My God, Lenny.  What is it?", Black.  Jack., L551005, L551004,m200
 Blackjack?  I don't understand--," Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.", L551007, L551006,m200
 And gives it to you., Wants to share., L551027, L551026,m200

" Jesus, Mace.  Back off."," This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.", L551035, L551034,m200
 Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me., So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--, L551039, L551038,m200
 Is this great fabric or what?, You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?, L551072, L551071,m200
 He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot., So that gives you something., L551076, L551075,m200
 Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.," I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...", L551079, L551078,m200
" No more, Lenny.", Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad., L551081, L551080,m200
" She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.", It's not your fault., L551083, L551082,m200

 No it doesn't., Because Iris knew somebody was after her., L551089, L551088,m200
" She said ""If they get me"".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.", So the guy's not a sicko., L551091, L551090,m200
" If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko."," Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?", L551093, L551092,m200
 Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?, That's where it gets a little strange., L551095, L551094,m200
 And what about the guy that was following me?, Now you're really getting paranoid., L551097, L551096,m200
" The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?", Sure., L551099, L551098,m200
 How's Zander?, OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him., L551101, L551100,m200
" I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.", S'okay.  I know you still love me., L551103, L551102,m200
 Whatup Lenny?," Jesus, Mace!", L551121, L551120,m200
 Where we going?, Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car., L551123, L551122,m200

 Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.," Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!", L551129, L551128,m200
 You better keep a low profile for a while., No shit.  You got someplace in mind?, L551131, L551130,m200
" Lenny, have you lost it completely?"," Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  ""A Love Supreme."" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.", L551135, L551134,m200

 Shit!, Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant., L551172, L551171,m200

 Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!," It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.", L551176, L551175,m200

 Are you out of your fucking mind?!," Fire's out, isn't it?", L551180, L551179,m200
 I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.," Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.", L551186, L551185,m200
 Those two guys were cops., You sure?, L551191, L551190,m200
 Tell me., I can't tell you.  You've got to see., L551201, L551200,m200
 Uh unh.  I won't do it., Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important., L551203, L551202,m200
" Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?", I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all., L551225, L551224,m200
 We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance., You know what this tape could do if it gets out., L551229, L551228,m200
" I've got a good idea, yeah.", People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see., L551231, L551230,m200
" So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny."," Well, look at the plus side.", L551239, L551238,m200
 There's a plus side?, Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you., L551241, L551240,m200
 It was a tough call., I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops., L551243, L551242,m200
 I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her., Why?, L551245, L551244,m200
 He's totally cut off from the outer world., How long does it last?  Oh., L551254, L551253,m200
" The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow..."," Yeah, right, blow it open.", L551266, L551265,m200
 Who's Strickland?, Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him., L551271, L551270,m200
 Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch., Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way., L551294, L551293,m200
" Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--", I'm not going., L551323, L551322,m200
 Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--," Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.", L551325, L551324,m200
 Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.," It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...", L551333, L551332,m200
 I guess., And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?, L551335, L551334,m200
" I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.", You never told me., L551338, L551337,m200
" But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left."," No, it's not.", L551340, L551339,m200
 Mace... you're a girl.," Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.", L551344, L551343,m200
 Got your ticket?, No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake., L551346, L551345,m200
 You see Tran?, Uh unh., L551348, L551347,m200
 Alright.  We're going up., And do what?  Take on his whole posse?, L551351, L551350,m200

 Who are you?, I think you know. Your eyes say you do., L584028, L584027,m215
 [Beat] You're his son?," No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.", L584030, L584029,m215
" You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital."," I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?", L584033, L584032,m215
" No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.", I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know., L584035, L584034,m215
 I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer..., I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there., L584037, L584036,m215
 I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out., How?, L584039, L584038,m215
" Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...", Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?, L584042, L584041,m215
 It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...," So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?", L584044, L584043,m215
 The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.," No, we were patients.", L584046, L584045,m215
 How did you come to know their names?," You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.", L584051, L584050,m215
 I don't understand...," I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?", L584053, L584052,m215
 I didn't put you in Alpine Grove., No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket., L584055, L584054,m215
 Do I know you from somewhere?," You may have known my father, William Starks.", L583874, L583873,m215
" That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.", He didn't either., L583876, L583875,m215
 Did you know my father?," Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?", L583878, L583877,m215
 My father used to talk about you.," Oh yeah, what'd he say?", L583882, L583881,m215
" Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...", That's too bad., L583885, L583884,m215
 I thought you said you never knew your father., I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?, L583887, L583886,m215
 He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it., I never touched your father! I swear!, L583890, L583889,m215
 We're late., I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have., L583742, L583741,m215
 It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about., They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for., L583745, L583744,m215
 What should they be looking for?, They should just be looking harder., L583747, L583746,m215
" Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?", Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now., L583749, L583748,m215
 You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?, I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams., L583496, L583495,m215
 You done with your small talk?, Sure., L583498, L583497,m215
" This is really happening, isn't it?", [Beat] What do you need me to do?, L584133, L584132,m215
 I need to get this letter to someone., I can't take you out of here in your condition..., L584136, L584135,m215
 And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.," No, it hasn't.", L584138, L584137,m215
" I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then."," His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?", L583809, L583808,m215
" No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more."," What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.", L583811, L583810,m215
" Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.", What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?, L583813, L583812,m215
 Get your fucking hands off my daughter!," Mom, he just fixed our car.", L583429, L583428,m215
" I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it..."," Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...", L584156, L584155,m215
" Jackie, go play in the snow.", Why?, L584161, L584160,m215
" Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...", You two ok?, L583414, L583413,m215
 Your mom take anything before this happened?," Yeah, but I don't know what.", L583418, L583417,m215
 [Beat] What's your name?, Jackie., L583420, L583419,m215
 But I like it I guess.," Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?", L583425, L583424,m215
 You're just gonna walk?," Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.", L583435, L583434,m215
 What're those?, Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification., L583437, L583436,m215
 What for?," [Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.", L583439, L583438,m215
 I think I can remember what's on them., William Starks. [Beat] Thanks., L583441, L583440,m215
 What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything., [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me., L583616, L583615,m215
" Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.", What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?, L583619, L583618,m215
" No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital."," Well, you belong in one.", L583621, L583620,m215
" Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back."," I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.", L583623, L583622,m215
 You can't be William Starks. He's dead., [Beat] What?, L583625, L583624,m215
 William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave., [Beat] What?, L583627, L583626,m215
 I looked it up., How?, L583630, L583629,m215
 I gave you my dog tags.," No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.", L583632, L583631,m215
 How'd he die?," I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.", L583634, L583633,m215
" I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now."," It's December 25th, 1993 today.", L583636, L583635,m215
" I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave."," I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.", L583639, L583638,m215
" The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?", Yeah., L583789, L583788,m215
 But no one knew until after..., After I..., L583792, L583791,m215
 [Beat] You bled to death., What?, L583794, L583793,m215
 Do you really believe me?," I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...", L583797, L583796,m215
 [Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?, Yes., L583799, L583798,m215
 Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do., I know., L583801, L583800,m215
 Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you., If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?, L583803, L583802,m215
 I didn't kill Officer Harrison., I know., L583805, L583804,m215
 How? Did they figure it out after I died?, No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them., L583807, L583806,m215
 I don't believe a thing she just said.," Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?", L583859, L583858,m215
 I have no idea., You think Lorenson kills you?, L583861, L583860,m215
" Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.", Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with., L583863, L583862,m215
 Why?, Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled., L583865, L583864,m215
 How long do we have?, I don't know., L583893, L583892,m215
 What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy., I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say., L583897, L583896,m215
 Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days., You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't., L583899, L583898,m215
 I might not be able to.," It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...", L583901, L583900,m215
" Me, too."," Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.", L583999, L583998,m215
 You're sure?," Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.", L584001, L584000,m215
 They're not here., They're not., L584003, L584002,m215
 What? What are you thinking?, There're no cars on this street., L584008, L584007,m215
 I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?," I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.", L584011, L584010,m215
 Then why isn't there anyone around?, [Beat] I don't know., L584013, L584012,m215
 Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?, It's Sunday., L584018, L584017,m215
 They've got lives to be grateful for.," William, you're not making sense.", L584022, L584021,m215
 That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.," No, he didn't.", L584058, L584057,m215
" If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face."," Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?", L584063, L584062,m215
 Where are we going?, To the hospital., L584065, L584064,m215
 What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?, Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through., L584068, L584067,m215
 Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her., Ok. Ssh. Rest., L584071, L584070,m215
 What?," When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?", L584085, L584084,m215
 You gotta stop thinking like that.," Then, where are you going?", L584088, L584087,m215
 I've been ok., Good. How's your mom?, L584149, L584148,m215
" [Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.", Ok., L584171, L584170,m215
 I think so., You're bleeding pretty bad there., L584183, L584182,m215
 It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?, I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive., L584185, L584184,m215
 How you doin'?, I'm doing fine., L584194, L584193,m215
" Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?"," It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.", L583834, L583833,m215
 How?, He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him., L583836, L583835,m215
 I don't understand.," I still don't either, even after all these years.", L583838, L583837,m215
 Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.," I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.", L583851, L583850,m215
 And if I didn't want to come?, I guess I'd ask you why., L583704, L583703,m215
 Because I don't think I'm crazy., You're not crazy., L583706, L583705,m215
 You were convicted of the crime.," That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.", L583709, L583708,m215
 You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged., No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind., L583711, L583710,m215
" Why, what would you do?", I could try to...make it stop., L583716, L583715,m215
 No. I don't want it to., So it's helping?, L583718, L583717,m215
 You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.," Believe me, I know.", L583720, L583719,m215
 My God you look exactly like him., I never knew my father. Did you?, L583824, L583823,m215
" Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.", Why?, L583826, L583825,m215
" At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.", You thought my father was crazy?, L583828, L583827,m215
 What case?, I was working with a boy named Eugene., L583831, L583830,m215
 How'd he get it?, [Beat] I don't know., L583841, L583840,m215
 But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was..., I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here., L583843, L583842,m215
" Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?", How do you know about Dr. Becker?, L583845, L583844,m215
" So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.", Why would we do that?, L583849, L583848,m215
" It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?"," [Beat] Yeah, it is.", L583854, L583853,m215
 Exactly., Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out., L583856, L583855,m215
 You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition., I'll die either way., L583903, L583902,m215
 What do you mean?, You have no idea what's going on., L583907, L583906,m215
" No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.", Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place., L583909, L583908,m215
 You don't understand.," Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.", L583912, L583911,m215
 I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?, Come on. Tell me what you do know., L583917, L583916,m215

 The future doesn't look different?, No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from., L583925, L583924,m215
 What about the world?, I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life., L583927, L583926,m215
 [Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?, Maybe., L583931, L583930,m215
 Why don't you help me?, Because I don't have time., L583934, L583933,m215
 Why not?, I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it., L583936, L583935,m215
 And how do you know that?, Because of the future. I know what's going to happen., L583938, L583937,m215
 How do you know about Eugene?, You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me., L583942, L583941,m215
 Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.," I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.", L583945, L583944,m215

And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?, I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time., L78253, L78252,m265
" Cabin fever, hon?", I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?, L78262, L78261,m265
 Maybe this is heaven., In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper., L78264, L78263,m265
" Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again."," Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.", L78266, L78265,m265
" God, it's Jane Butterfield!", What's she doing here?, L78270, L78269,m265
" She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.", Won't?  Or can't?, L78273, L78272,m265
" Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'", Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right..., L78275, L78274,m265
" I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!", That's my girl!, L78279, L78278,m265
" Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.", They make gypsies look good., L78309, L78308,m265

" Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.", Not really...  what's this?, L78388, L78387,m265
" That's it?  No number, or instructions?", Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it..., L78391, L78390,m265
 That little girl saw us., She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us., L78409, L78408,m265
 But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it., That's all we need., L78411, L78410,m265
 There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge., We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl., L78433, L78432,m265
 What about this Beetle guy?, We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl., L78435, L78434,m265
 Are you crazy?  She can't hear you., I don't know... what are you looking up?, L78437, L78436,m265

" My God, we're back where we started."," Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.", L78491, L78490,m265

" That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam."," Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.", L78528, L78527,m265
" God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?"," Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.", L78547, L78546,m265
 I feel really stupid., It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!, L78551, L78550,m265
" Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.", Where are your skulls and bones?, L78587, L78586,m265

 Go ahead... third time's a charm., <u>Betelgeuse</u>!, L78626, L78625,m265
 What happened?, Three times.  Powerful number., L78628, L78627,m265
" Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig."," Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.", L78632, L78631,m265
 I guess we open it., Maybe we should knock first?, L78635, L78634,m265
 She's only fourteen..., ... acts like she's thirty-five., L78647, L78646,m265
 Honey.  Let's go., Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help., L78655, L78654,m265

 Otho'll know what to do., What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?, L78801, L78800,m265
 Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration., Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing..., L78803, L78802,m265
 Just don't tell Lydia., Why not?, L78805, L78804,m265
 They're probably guilty about what they did to me., Not these people!  They are ruthless!, L78911, L78910,m265
" What do you think, honey?", Delia hates it., L78290, L78289,m265
" Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.", My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room., L78378, L78377,m265

 Where is your mother?, Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers., L78413, L78412,m265
 I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key., Let me have it., L78421, L78420,m265
" Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...", Stepmother., L78424, L78423,m265
 What?, I'm lonely., L78428, L78427,m265
" Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!", Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw., L78447, L78446,m265

 The attic room is locked --, They're ghosts.  They do what they want., L78735, L78734,m265
 Answer your mother.," Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?", L78745, L78744,m265
 Look at all that <u>parking</u>!, Come on.  Leave their stuff alone., L78750, L78749,m265

 I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts., I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!, L78761, L78760,m265
 They're... not here anymore.," Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.", L78903, L78902,m265
 Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!, Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere., L78535, L78534,m265
" Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody..."," No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.", L78539, L78538,m265
" Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you?

 Are they suffering?, They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing., L78947, L78946,m265
 I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.," This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?", L78376, L78375,m265

" <u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.", Any particular kind?, L78406, L78405,m265
" I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.

 Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon., It wasn't a joke., L78680, L78679,m265
" I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --", Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali., L78727, L78726,m265
" All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!", Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide., L78741, L78740,m265
" Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.", I'm sorry already., L78756, L78755,m265
 That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.," I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.", L78299, L78298,m265
 Is the rest of the house as bad as this?, The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?, L78303, L78302,m265
 What's wrong?, I thought I saw something., L78316, L78315,m265
 Okay?, You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural., L78318, L78317,m265

 Is this the key to the attic?, That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me., L78399, L78398,m265

" It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter.

" Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig."," Let her go, Craig. I mean ôhim.""", L82703, L82702,m267
" And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.", I've never been looked at like this by a woman., L82734, L82733,m267
 Ah.," After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.", L82746, L82745,m267
 Yes?, I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?, L82804, L82803,m267
 When?, Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly., L82806, L82805,m267

 We have to meet., One hour., L82957, L82956,m267
" Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!"," Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.", L82965, L82964,m267
" But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved."," I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.", L82967, L82966,m267
" Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.", Did you see the reviews?, L83131, L83130,m267
" Yeah, I saw them"," Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.", L83133, L83132,m267
 She's not available.," We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.", L83137, L83136,m267
 How do we do that?," A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.", L83141, L83140,m267
 What's the play?," Say... ""Equus""? It's got everything.", L83143, L83142,m267
 Never heard of it., Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society., L83145, L83144,m267
 Sounds boring. Are there any songs?," Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.", L83147, L83146,m267
" I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of ""Long Day's Journey Into Night.""", Great then., L83149, L83148,m267
 Is there dancing?, No., L83151, L83150,m267

 Who's calling?," You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.", L82713, L82712,m267
 How'd you get this number?," It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...", L82715, L82714,m267
 Can I get you a drink?, Whatever you're having., L82736, L82735,m267
 Thanks so much for coming over.," Oh, I'm really glad you called.", L82808, L82807,m267

" Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte."," Yes, Maxine, yes.", L82818, L82817,m267
" Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!"," Oh, Lotte...", L82885, L82884,m267
 Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.," Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.", L82887, L82886,m267
 Darling!, What the fuck is going on?, L82913, L82912,m267
 Come on in.," I can explain about the portal, darling.", L82970, L82969,m267
" Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court."," Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?", L82972, L82971,m267
 Yes. How did you know it was me?, Lotte called me., L82974, L82973,m267
" Oh, so the bitch escaped.", Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now., L82976, L82975,m267
 I'm getting better all the time.," I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.", L82978, L82977,m267
" You still there, sweets?"," Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.", L82995, L82994,m267
" Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.", You mean with Malkovich?, L82997, L82996,m267
 I'd love to see your work., Really? Yeah. Okay., L82999, L82998,m267
 That was incredible. You're brilliant!," You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.", L83002, L83001,m267
 Stay in him forever?," No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?", L83005, L83004,m267
" Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally."," No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.", L83007, L83006,m267
 No one would ever have to know its not him., Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!, L83009, L83008,m267
" Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute."," It's okay, my sweet.", L83017, L83016,m267
 Vegas., Vegas. Can you arrange that?, L83040, L83039,m267
" This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.", I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today., L83087, L83086,m267
 Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?, He's a selfish bastard., L83089, L83088,m267
" They love me, darling! ""Craig Schwartz is fantastic!""  The New York Times. ""If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!""  Women's Wear Daily.

" Bad dream, darling?", I've got to leave Malkovich., L83121, L83120,m267
 You've got to be kidding., I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it., L83123, L83122,m267
" Honey, we can be happy and poor together.", Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again., L83127, L83126,m267
 Yeah what?!, Derek Mantini!, L83129, L83128,m267
" Good-bye, Maxine.", Whatever., L83201, L83200,m267
 Captain Mertin?," What want ye, girl child?", L82448, L82447,m267
" I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions."," I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.", L82450, L82449,m267
" I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.", Aye. Speak then if ye must., L82452, L82451,m267
 What?," They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.", L89712, L89711,m271
 Why?, Survival., L89730, L89729,m271
" Seems like he's doing me a favor, then."," You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.", L89736, L89735,m271
 Two years.," Then they weren't created to go after your ""patient zero"".", L89742, L89741,m271
" You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it."," What the hell are you doing, Blade?", L89758, L89757,m271
 Where to first?, The House of Pain., L89778, L89777,m271
 This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here., I haven't forgotten., L89791, L89790,m271
 What is it with you people and pain?," We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.", L89796, L89795,m271
 What was that?, Nothing., L89804, L89803,m271
 You're hurt., I'll heal., L89818, L89817,m271
 What about Nomak?, He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic., L89820, L89819,m271
 how long since he was bitten?, Minutes., L89826, L89825,m271
 Recognize him?, From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked., L89858, L89857,m271
 Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.," Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?", L89860, L89859,m271
 No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.," If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.", L89863, L89862,m271
" I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.", Like cancer with a purpose., L89870, L89869,m271
 He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive., You don't have to hunt to do it., L89908, L89907,m271
 Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead., Fry 'em., L89952, L89951,m271
 Blade., Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!, L89974, L89973,m271
 Each day is a little life., What?, L89984, L89983,m271
 Anyone else make it?, I don't think so., L89987, L89986,m271
 Thank you., For what?, L89989, L89988,m271
" It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.", I wouldn't read too much into it., L89991, L89990,m271
 You don't want to go there., Why?, L89993, L89992,m271
 Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends., It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies., L89995, L89994,m271
" Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off."," If that's true, then why'd you save me?", L89997, L89996,m271
 Why do you hate us so much?, I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood., L89999, L89998,m271
 You're hurting me.," Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?", L90003, L90002,m271

 You came back for me., Did you think I wouldn't?, L89672, L89671,m271
 Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --, You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else., L89675, L89674,m271
" I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.", Either that or feeding the worms., L89709, L89708,m271
 What do you think?, Sounds like a plan., L89745, L89744,m271
 What do you really think?, These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get., L89747, L89746,m271
" He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.", I don't like it., L89786, L89785,m271
 I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs., Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself., L89835, L89834,m271
" Where were you, Whistler?", I'll show you., L89841, L89840,m271
" You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.", I wouldn't worry about it., L89888, L89887,m271
" I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.", Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy., L89890, L89889,m271
 What the hell is that supposed to mean?," It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?", L89892, L89891,m271
 Eau de suckhead.  Tasty., We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out., L89939, L89938,m271
" Your security's for shit, kid.", Where the hell have you been?, L90015, L90014,m271
" What's your problem, Whistler?", Why don't you ask your girlfriend?, L90019, L90018,m271
" I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.", Then who does he work for?, L90021, L90020,m271
" Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!", Blood..., L90089, L90088,m271
 And so will we.," Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?", L89880, L89879,m271
" Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.", You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can., L89882, L89881,m271
 Must be hundreds of these skeletons here., So?, L89946, L89945,m271
" Put it back in park, Blade.", Thought you were dead., L90042, L90041,m271
" It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.", For what?, L89722, L89721,m271
 You want me to hunt them for you., Not alone., L89738, L89737,m271
 The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?, I should think that would be obvious at this point., L90037, L90036,m271
" True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.", Too bad you're out of it., L90078, L90077,m271
 And why is that?, Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him., L90080, L90079,m271
" You got something in mind, Blade?"," Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.", L89662, L89661,m271

" Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt."," You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.", L90047, L90046,m271

 His name is Jared Nomak.," Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.", L89734, L89733,m271
 I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?, Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?, L90070, L90069,m271
" From his father, of course."," You experimented on your own, son?", L90072, L90071,m271

 Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping., Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower., L89685, L89684,m271

" Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?", I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me., L164524, L164523,m322
" Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?", Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around., L164526, L164525,m322
" Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez."," Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.", L164528, L164527,m322
 Say ... about the interest ...," Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...", L164532, L164531,m322
 Loan shark -- hey?, Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens., L164191, L164190,m322
 Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?, Sure am., L164193, L164192,m322
 Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.," That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.", L164201, L164200,m322
 I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington., Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--, L164203, L164202,m322
 What do you want?," Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?", L164285, L164284,m322
 What Grange?, That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day., L164287, L164286,m322
" Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.", I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone., L164291, L164290,m322
 Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?," Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.", L165031, L165030,m322
 You're not -- Dorothy., No. She's gone., L164608, L164607,m322
 She couldn't be gone!, But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill., L164610, L164609,m322
 Never mind. What's your name?, Belle., L164614, L164613,m322
 Stevens!," Well, Stone -- have you got the money?", L164332, L164331,m322
 I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --," No, Stone!", L164334, L164333,m322
 -- in gold., I'd like to know where you'd get it...., L164336, L164335,m322

 Where's everybody?, I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?, L164832, L164831,m322
" Now run along, Daniel."," What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?", L164847, L164846,m322

 Why do you fret about something that isn't there?, Don't say that -- I know it is --, L164858, L164857,m322
 All right -- so it's buried with you!, What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?, L164860, L164859,m322
" Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?", I do -- and I think you should too., L164862, L164861,m322

 You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --, Opportunities?, L164276, L164275,m322
" Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you."," Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--", L164278, L164277,m322
 Where did it come from?," Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!", L164293, L164292,m322
" Yes, why shouldn't it?"," Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.", L164295, L164294,m322
 It's mine?," That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.", L164297, L164296,m322
 What does it mean here -- about my soul?," Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--", L164299, L164298,m322
" No, no! Give it to me!"," A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?", L164301, L164300,m322

" .... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.", He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there., L164893, L164892,m322
 Are they all as -- small -- as that?," Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --", L164897, L164896,m322
" Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?", I'm through with you., L164900, L164899,m322

" I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...", No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now., L164908, L164907,m322

 Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?, Never!, L164952, L164951,m322
 Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?," Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.", L164990, L164989,m322
" Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me."," But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?", L164995, L164994,m322

I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!"," That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?", L164872, L164871,m322
 What -- what's on your mind?," You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?", L164874, L164873,m322

That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.", I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --, L164878, L164877,m322

 Yeah ..., Help you I can ... yes ... yes., L191999, L191998,m337
 I'm looking for a great warrior., A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great., L192001, L192000,m337

 Give me that!, Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not., L192008, L192007,m337
 I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole., Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is., L192010, L192009,m337
" Mine, mine."," Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.", L192014, L192013,m337
" No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.", I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master., L192016, L192015,m337
" Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.", You know the Jedi Master?, L192018, L192017,m337
" ... I told you, I'm not hungry.", Patience.  It's time to eat., L192061, L192060,m337

 Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?," Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?", L192065, L192064,m337
" Because of my father, I guess."," Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.", L192067, L192066,m337
 Yes sir!," Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?", L191640, L191639,m337
 I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.," Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!", L191642, L191641,m337
" Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.", Not likely!  Where are the speeders?, L191649, L191648,m337
 We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ..., We'll have to go out on Tauntauns., L191651, L191650,m337

 The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker., Then I'll see you in Hell., L191655, L191654,m337
" What is thy bidding, My Master?", There is a grave disturbance in The Force., L192091, L192090,m337
 I have felt it., Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction., L192093, L192092,m337
 Our destruction?  Who?, The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing., L192095, L192094,m337
" He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...", You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed., L192097, L192096,m337
" But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.", Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset., L192099, L192098,m337
 Captain Solo.  What's the situation?," There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.", L191594, L191593,m337
" Good, and Commander Skywalker?", He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon., L191596, L191595,m337
" With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.", The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going., L191598, L191597,m337
 That's right., You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you., L191601, L191600,m337
" Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man."," I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.", L191603, L191602,m337
" Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.", Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you., L191710, L191709,m337
" Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?", What is it?, L191633, L191632,m337
" Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.", I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?, L191635, L191634,m337

 What are you so grouchy about?," Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?", L191969, L191968,m337
" You, too, golden rod.", I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior., L191988, L191987,m337

 That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind., Does Luke know?, L191609, L191608,m337
" He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ...

 You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...," And what are they, pray tell?", L191617, L191616,m337
 You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.," I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.", L191619, L191618,m337
 Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss., I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee., L191622, L191621,m337
" There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.", We are fighting for a cause much ..., L191624, L191623,m337
 Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet., And you think you're the one to apply some heat?, L191626, L191625,m337
" Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...", Forget it., L191688, L191687,m337
 Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.," No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.", L191691, L191690,m337
 .... I'm afraid there's not much left., What was it?, L191713, L191712,m337
 Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ...., An Imperial probe droid., L191715, L191714,m337
" Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.", I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from., L191759, L191758,m337
 I don't know what he's talking about., Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet., L191765, L191764,m337
 You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.," Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?", L191769, L191768,m337
" Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder."," Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?", L191771, L191770,m337
 Hey!  Someone's still in here.," Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.", L191851, L191850,m337
 Would it help if I got out and pushed?," Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.", L191869, L191868,m337
 This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade., This baby's got a few surprises left in her., L191873, L191872,m337
" I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?", Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us., L191893, L191892,m337
 That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ...., Or you ran into something ...., L191919, L191918,m337
" Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...", Probably an asteroid field ...., L191921, L191920,m337
 Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need., To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?, L191923, L191922,m337
" Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.", I take it back., L191934, L191933,m337
 That Star Destroyer is slowing down., Good., L191936, L191935,m337
 But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer., I'm against that., L191938, L191937,m337
 We've got to get out of this shower., Now you're making sense., L191940, L191939,m337
" There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.", What is it?, L191946, L191945,m337
" Why, Princess, this is so sudden.", Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry., L191976, L191975,m337
 You don't look angry., How do I look?, L191978, L191977,m337
" Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited."," Well, I hope you don't expect more.", L191982, L191981,m337
" I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.", Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go., L191984, L191983,m337
 That was no earthquake., Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser., L192031, L192030,m337
 They're moving away., They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe., L192034, L192033,m337
" Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.", Would you please stop calling me that?, L192039, L192038,m337
 Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.," Yes, you do.", L192041, L192040,m337
" Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.", That's quite a compliment., L192044, L192043,m337
 Stop that., Why?, L192046, L192045,m337
 What are you afraid of?, Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy., L192049, L192048,m337
 Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.," Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.", L192053, L192052,m337
 There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized., You mean a man you can control., L192055, L192054,m337
 I do not!, Try and control this ..., L192057, L192056,m337
 There's something out there!, Where?, L192103, L192102,m337
 Are you crazy!," Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...", L192108, L192107,m337
 Looks like some kind of Mynock., There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now., L192112, L192111,m337
 Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.," Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!", L192121, L192120,m337
" I see it Chewie, hang on.", The entrance is collapsing!, L192124, L192123,m337
" Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.", No lightspeed?, L192161, L192160,m337
" Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.", You're going to attack them?!!!, L192166, L192165,m337
 You could have warned him before you shut him off.," Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?", L192208, L192207,m337
 I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.," Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.", L192210, L192209,m337
 What'd you have in mind for your next move?, The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed., L192212, L192211,m337
" Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?", Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?, L192214, L192213,m337
 That depends.  Where are we?, Here ... near the Anoat system., L192216, L192215,m337
" Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs."," You keep logs?  My, how organized.", L192218, L192217,m337
" Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.", Never heard of that system., L192220, L192219,m337
" Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.", A mining colony., L192222, L192221,m337
" A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.", Can you trust him?, L192224, L192223,m337
" You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them."," Let ╘er go, Chewie.", L192228, L192227,m337
 I don't like this., It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here., L192250, L192249,m337
 What are you staring at?, Who's staring?, L192292, L192291,m337
 You look silly., You look great., L192294, L192293,m337
 Has Threepio turned up yet?, Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out., L192296, L192295,m337
 I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right., Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now., L192298, L192297,m337
 He found him in a junk pile ...," Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.", L192302, L192301,m337
" Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident."," Chewie, do you think you can repair him?", L192304, L192303,m337
 No thanks.," Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...", L192308, L192307,m337
 I was worried about you., I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to., L192378, L192377,m337
" ... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true."," ... just remember that, ╘cause I'll be back ...", L192417, L192416,m337
" Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?", I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings., L191586, L191585,m337
 There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base., I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long., L191588, L191587,m337
" Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.", Thanks to you., L191756, L191755,m337
 Probe?  What probe?, That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight., L191761, L191760,m337
 About what?," Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.", L191767, L191766,m337
 I hope you make your peace with Jabba., Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us., L191798, L191797,m337
" Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.", No hard feelings?, L192252, L192251,m337
 Are you kidding?, I always said you were a gentleman., L192254, L192253,m337
" That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?", Repairs ..., L192264, L192263,m337
 That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?, Hyperdrive., L192268, L192267,m337
 How's your mining operation going?, Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?, L192271, L192270,m337
" Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.", I'm sorry too., L192327, L192326,m337
" Get out of here, Lando!", Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you., L192381, L192380,m337
 This ought to be good.," Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.", L192383, L192382,m337
 You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over., He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker., L192387, L192386,m337
 All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?," Don't ask me, but he's on his way.", L192392, L192391,m337
" Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ..."," Yeah, you're a real hero.", L192396, L192395,m337
 What about Leia and the Wookiee?, You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city., L192366, L192365,m337
 That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.," I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.", L192368, L192367,m337
 No., Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here., L192370, L192369,m337
" We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.", I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo., L192403, L192402,m337
 I'll take what's mine now.," Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.", L192424, L192423,m337
 That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--, I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further., L192426, L192425,m337
" Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?", You may call me Leia., L192260, L192259,m337
" Sorry, am I interrupting anything?", Not really., L192310, L192309,m337
" I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.", Thanks., L192312, L192311,m337
 .... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire., You're part of the mining guild then?, L192319, L192318,m337
 It's a lovely outpost.," Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.", L192322, L192321,m337
 What about Han?, I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter., L192385, L192384,m337
 Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ..., ... we're the bait., L192390, L192389,m337
 What's going on?," I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.", L192434, L192433,m337
" Look, I stand to lose everything by this.", We have no use for your kind., L192437, L192436,m337
 Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.," There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.", L192446, L192445,m337

 For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.," I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.", L281451, L281450,m388
 Detective Bedsoe., Lieutenant., L281419, L281418,m388
 When did you get back?, A few days ago., L281424, L281423,m388
 Where were you last night around nine?, I already told you.  I took a walk., L281428, L281427,m388
 Tell me again.  Where'd you go?, Central Park., L281430, L281429,m388
 Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?, No.  I don't scare easy., L281432, L281431,m388
 Where have you been for the last seven years?, Around., L281434, L281433,m388
 She was a good woman., You didn't bring me here to talk about her., L281438, L281437,m388
 I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?, No., L281441, L281440,m388
 You sure?, He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head., L281443, L281442,m388
" I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.", Is that it?, L281456, L281455,m388
" No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours."," Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.", L281458, L281457,m388
" Good evening, Lieutenant."," No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.", L281784, L281783,m388
 I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it., That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were., L281786, L281785,m388
 Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him., Maybe he was a lousy shot., L281789, L281788,m388
 Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face., Most people are afraid of death., L281791, L281790,m388
 Yes -- I think it is., Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?, L281814, L281813,m388
" You'll have no need for that, Highlander."," Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.", L281287, L281286,m388
 I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?, Aye., L281290, L281289,m388
 You?, No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand., L281292, L281291,m388
" We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.", Who are you?, L281294, L281293,m388
 Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life., I learned my fill from Romeriz., L281296, L281295,m388
 The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it., There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good., L281306, L281305,m388
 The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.," Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.", L281308, L281307,m388
" You cannot run from your destiny, Conner."," Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.", L281311, L281310,m388
 Must you do that?, What?, L281348, L281347,m388
 Sing., It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it., L281350, L281349,m388
 Can't you enjoy it quietly?, Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?, L281352, L281351,m388

 The river., That's all?, L281358, L281357,m388
" Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.", That is what bothers me., L281361, L281360,m388
 I'm leaving., Leaving what?, L281367, L281366,m388
 England.  There is nothing for me here anymore., And what do you think you will find in another land?, L281369, L281368,m388
 Maybe myself., Then it's worth the journey., L281371, L281370,m388
" Thank you, Thomas.", For what?, L281373, L281372,m388
 For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again., I'm sure they will., L281375, L281374,m388
 As friends -- always as friends.," We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.", L281377, L281376,m388
 That is a thought that doesn't please me., If it came down to it what would you do?, L281379, L281378,m388

 France., How long is the voyage?, L281501, L281500,m388
 Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?, Me?  Of course., L281503, L281502,m388
 What are we doing here?, Living.  Remember?, L281556, L281555,m388
 To ask her to dance., She's the King's cousin., L281561, L281560,m388
 Yes., What worries you?, L281574, L281573,m388
 You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?, I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone., L281577, L281576,m388
 That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?, No.  What am I to do?, L281580, L281579,m388
 Well?, It's done., L281602, L281601,m388
 I'll go first., No -- I will., L281616, L281615,m388

 This cannot be.," It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.", L281247, L281246,m388
 Agreed., I would like to say goodbye., L281249, L281248,m388
 How comes it your are not afraid?, Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?, L281176, L281175,m388

 Your life., How?, L281180, L281179,m388
 We had a bargain.  You promised., I lied., L281188, L281187,m388
 Aye?, Where do you go when your mind drifts?, L281565, L281564,m388
 Different places., The past?, L281567, L281566,m388
 Sometimes., Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there., L281569, L281568,m388

 Bullet proof vests don't bleed., You got me., L281541, L281540,m388
 Why do I feel that you know what's going on?," Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?", L281543, L281542,m388
 If it's good advice., This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this., L281545, L281544,m388

 Do you always walk around with a sword?, New York is dangerous place., L281693, L281692,m388
 You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe., About what?, L281695, L281694,m388
 It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book., I'm interested in mythology., L281697, L281696,m388
 No., You look like you have., L281700, L281699,m388

 I'm just trying to place you., I've lived all over the world., L281730, L281729,m388
 You're not an easy person to get to know., Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?, L281732, L281731,m388
 How come you wanted to meet tonight?, I wanted to get to know you better., L281734, L281733,m388

" Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.", So?, L281754, L281753,m388
 Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them., If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall., L281756, L281755,m388
 That would mean they'd been trapped in there--, --for three hundred years., L281759, L281758,m388

 What now?, Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another., L281821, L281820,m388
 Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt., Where is the film crew from the British Museum?, L281279, L281278,m388
 They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark., Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented., L281281, L281280,m388
 We're holding the workers down below., Why?, L281314, L281313,m388
 Someone broke into the cavern last night., What?  How?, L281316, L281315,m388
 He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside., How could they get by him?, L281319, L281318,m388
 We found him this morning., What's that next to him?, L281322, L281321,m388
 Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication., I don't think it is a duplication., L281326, L281325,m388
 It has to be., And this?, L281328, L281327,m388

" It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.

 I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?, Fine., L281552, L281551,m388

 Have you ever been caught?, Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them., L305528, L305527,m399
 The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead., But how do you know?, L305532, L305531,m399
 Read her thoughts., I can't., L305534, L305533,m399
 What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell., I don't know any hell -, L305544, L305543,m399

" Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.", Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?, L305636, L305635,m399

 Lestat!," You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -", L305642, L305641,m399

 Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?, Nope., L355339, L355338,m424

 What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --," Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.", L355357, L355356,m424
 That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew., Knew what?, L355359, L355358,m424

" If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.", What is he?, L355533, L355532,m424

 Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm., Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared..., L355234, L355233,m424
 I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered., Did your husband know Quaid?, L355062, L355061,m424
" Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.", You don't?, L355064, L355063,m424
 What's the connection?, I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past., L355067, L355066,m424

 We haven't slept in the same bed for years., But obviously you still care what happens to him., L355074, L355073,m424
 You don't believe me., He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery., L355077, L355076,m424

 Well... how about some of the other illusionists?, They won't tell you anything., L355162, L355161,m424
 I can be very persuasive., Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee., L355164, L355163,m424
 How did it go today?, I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there., L355241, L355240,m424

 Okay.  I'll keep digging., Yes.  You do that., L355253, L355252,m424
 Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?, I didn't leave.  I was just digging around., L355378, L355377,m424

" Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?"," It was more than that, I think.", L355384, L355383,m424
" He was the real thing, right?"," Swann said he could do stuff, yes.", L355386, L355385,m424
 Stuff?, He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire., L355388, L355387,m424
 He taught all this to Swann?, Some or it., L355390, L355389,m424
" So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.", I told you --, L355392, L355391,m424
" Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.", No., L355394, L355393,m424
 You said you weren't with him for love., I wasn't., L355396, L355395,m424
 What then?," I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.", L355398, L355397,m424
 It's okay., No it isn't.  You can't help me., L355402, L355401,m424

 What about me?, Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann., L355451, L355450,m424

 What were you doing up there?, I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud., L354975, L354974,m424
" Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.", Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read., L354977, L354976,m424
 What makes you so sure?, I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?, L354979, L354978,m424
 Where the fuck is he?, He got up and walked., L354982, L354981,m424
 And this Butterfield guy--, --vanished., L355152, L355151,m424
 Are you finished with me?, For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?, L355155, L355154,m424

 Trickery and divinity., Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?, L355202, L355201,m424
" No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.", So could you walk on water?, L355204, L355203,m424
" I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.", What about Swann's miracles?, L355206, L355205,m424
 They weren't worth a damn., I heard he was the best., L355208, L355207,m424
 You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.," Oh, I've got plenty.", L355211, L355210,m424

 Philip Swann?, You know of him?, L355045, L355044,m424
 I saw him in Vegas once., Are you a gambling man?, L355047, L355046,m424
 When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician., Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist., L355049, L355048,m424
 What's the difference?, Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real., L355051, L355050,m424
 Any movie stars buried here?, Probably., L355053, L355052,m424
 It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view., I don't think the dead much care., L355055, L355054,m424
 Are you sure?," Are you a believer, then?", L355057, L355056,m424
 Who is she?, Swann's wife., L355060, L355059,m424
 What the fuck are you doing here?, Looking for you.  I tried the hotel., L355258, L355257,m424

" You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.", She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone., L355264, L355263,m424
 Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered., Yes.  It's regrettable, L355266, L355265,m424
 Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why., What for?  You need to stay busy?, L355268, L355267,m424

 You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?, Yes., L355441, L355440,m424
" And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann", I tried to pay you off., L355443, L355442,m424
 Was that Swann's idea?," No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.", L355445, L355444,m424
" Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.", Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?, L355447, L355446,m424
 I want to see Swann face to face., Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?, L355449, L355448,m424
 D'Amour --, Shit..., L355553, L355552,m424
 Him too., We've got to get you to a hospital., L355561, L355560,m424

 Jennifer's only ever had one visitor., A Mister Quaid?, L355275, L355274,m424
" Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.", I won't say anything., L355277, L355276,m424
" Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.", What's her problem?, L355279, L355278,m424
 She has no real grip on reality., Does anybody?, L355281, L355280,m424
 Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together., And what does Jennifer think's real?, L355283, L355282,m424
 You need an ambulance., Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?, L354959, L354958,m424
 My God., What?, L354962, L354961,m424
 You've taken some strange journeys in your life., Yeah.  You could say that., L354964, L354963,m424

" He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.", I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys., L355182, L355181,m424

 For an introduction., Well... nobody., L355186, L355185,m424
 I only wear ties for funerals., You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen., L355189, L355188,m424
 Are they all in the business?, It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation., L355191, L355190,m424

" What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now."," Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.", L376376, L376375,m435
 What are their feelings?," If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.", L376378, L376377,m435
 What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?, I don't care., L376381, L376380,m435
 Whose?, Yours., L376384, L376383,m435
 I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me., I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth., L376386, L376385,m435
" I think it's time you went home, Drew.", Certainly.  Goodnight., L376388, L376387,m435
" Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?", I don't think so.  Do you?, L376433, L376432,m435
 That's it?, Bontecou wants a quick response and --, L376436, L376435,m435
" The answer is no, quick enough for you?", Don't you want to hear the details?, L376438, L376437,m435
" I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.", So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?, L376440, L376439,m435
" Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?"," Certainly, Bill.", L376442, L376441,m435
 I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all., But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?, L376450, L376449,m435
" In English, please.", Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday., L376452, L376451,m435
 I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --, The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all., L376760, L376759,m435
 I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --," No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.", L376784, L376783,m435
 And what do I get?, You get not to go to jail., L376786, L376785,m435
 You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof., Proof?  We've got plenty of proof., L376788, L376787,m435
" Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?"," Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --", L375608, L375607,m435
 You're overthinking it --, I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains., L375755, L375754,m435
" Well, I guess he's found one."," Joe, you do get around.", L375868, L375867,m435
" ...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up."," Thanks, Quince.", L376202, L376201,m435
" Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.", Are you?, L376204, L376203,m435
 We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe., 'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?, L376206, L376205,m435
 Yeah.," 'It's up to Joe', huh?", L376208, L376207,m435
" Yeah, that's what he said."," Well, that's very interesting.", L376210, L376209,m435
" I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.", Yeah.  Neat., L376212, L376211,m435
" I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff."," You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?", L376275, L376274,m435
" Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.", How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?, L376342, L376341,m435
 He was interested., -- But he was concerned about the timing?, L376344, L376343,m435
 The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe., 'It's up to Joe'?, L376346, L376345,m435
 What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!," That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.", L376463, L376462,m435
 I'm going to put a stop to this!," Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.", L376465, L376464,m435
 But I didn't mean to do it!," The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.", L376467, L376466,m435
 I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you., Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company., L376469, L376468,m435
" This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.", He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary., L376750, L376749,m435
 He said that?," Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.", L376752, L376751,m435

Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?", L376638, L376637,m435

 But you love me don't you?," Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.", L438368, L438367,m469
 There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.," Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.", L438380, L438379,m469
 I'm still waiting for the mortgage check., I mailed it to you on Wednesday., L438382, L438381,m469
" Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here."," Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.", L438384, L438383,m469
 You got a Tab?, I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them., L438387, L438386,m469
" You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...", I know. Put Scott through college., L438389, L438388,m469
 Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?, I'm not going., L438392, L438391,m469
 I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie., Charlie! Am I dead?, L438557, L438556,m469
 How do you feel?, Pretty strange., L438663, L438662,m469
" Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years."," Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.", L438666, L438665,m469
 You drive like a maniac!, I call this the staccato. , L438668, L438667,m469
" Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.", Oh yeah?, L438670, L438669,m469
 You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense., Refresh my memory., L438672, L438671,m469
 How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?, Maybe I blocked it out., L438674, L438673,m469
 It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?, Why wait?, L438677, L438676,m469
" Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?", They'll learn to live with it., L438679, L438678,m469
 Want me to drive you home later?, Would you?, L438682, L438681,m469
 Looking good out there., Thanks., L438737, L438736,m469
 I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious., I thought it had a lot of merit., L438739, L438738,m469
" In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah..."," Rejected, worthless, miserable.", L438741, L438740,m469
 Yeah. Like that., Good., L438743, L438742,m469
 Where did you get that sweater?," Great, isn't it?", L438834, L438833,m469
 It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.," Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?", L438836, L438835,m469
 Right. I promised my mother., Is this slow enough for you?, L438838, L438837,m469
" Charlie, how are you?", I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?, L438840, L438839,m469
" Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?", Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?, L438889, L438888,m469
 He's trying., Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?, L438891, L438890,m469
 There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you.., You're pretty charming when you want to be., L438895, L438894,m469
 Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you., Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in., L438900, L438899,m469
" You really love me, don't you?", You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will., L438902, L438901,m469
" Charlie, let's make love.", What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?, L438904, L438903,m469
 A lot's happened since last weekend., But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait., L438906, L438905,m469
 I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?, Who?, L438908, L438907,m469
 You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!," You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.", L438910, L438909,m469
 This is a mistake. We better forget it., You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood., L438913, L438912,m469
 I'm sorry Charlie., Save it., L438915, L438914,m469
 What do you know about classical music?, Nothing.. Selling is selling., L439032, L439031,m469
 Charlie. About last nights.., Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts., L439034, L439033,m469
 But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.," Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?", L439036, L439035,m469
" Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.", What am I going to do with you?, L439039, L439038,m469
 Charlie. I just had the strangest dream., I have to talk to you.., L439108, L439107,m469
 What are you doing here?, Let's go down to the basement., L439110, L439109,m469
 I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...," I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.", L439112, L439111,m469
" Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did ""Book of Love ùù Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..."" I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?", You know I never could stand your sarcasm., L439114, L439113,m469
" You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this."," And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?", L439116, L439115,m469
" Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man."," Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.", L439118, L439117,m469
 I will be happy if I have you. I love you., That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet., L439120, L439119,m469
 What are you talking about? Who's Janet?, I just can't trust you anymore., L439122, L439121,m469
 What about everything I said to you this afternoon...," That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!", L439124, L439123,m469
 But what has to be different?," Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.", L439126, L439125,m469
 What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?, I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me., L439128, L439127,m469
 What're you doing here?," I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.", L439235, L439234,m469
 Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?," Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.", L439238, L439237,m469
" Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..", How'd you know about that?, L439240, L439239,m469
 I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific., Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?, L439242, L439241,m469
 What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group., Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other., L439244, L439243,m469
 I'd forgotten how much music meant to you., That's real big of you., L439246, L439245,m469
 Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.," You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?", L439248, L439247,m469
" Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest."," Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.", L439250, L439249,m469
 Just take a look at it. ," If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?", L439252, L439251,m469
 Does this mean you like me again?, It means I care about you and what happens to you., L439254, L439253,m469
" Forget it, it'll never work."," Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.", L439293, L439292,m469
 What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?, I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you., L439355, L439354,m469
 Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there., You're going to listen to me., L439357, L439356,m469
 Let me got! Where are you taking me?, Right here. Now sit down., L439360, L439359,m469
" Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.", How could you possibly know what I've been going through?, L439362, L439361,m469
 What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice., What?, L439365, L439364,m469
" You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, ""Peggy, you're scared."" Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.", You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!, L439367, L439366,m469
 Will you take me back to my grandparents?, Of course., L439371, L439370,m469
" Oh, Charlie."," It opens, too. Look inside.", L439374, L439373,m469
 I love you., I know., L439379, L439378,m469
 I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain., Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?, L439381, L439380,m469
 Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!, I've got to go now., L439384, L439383,m469

 I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you., What about Janet?, L439399, L439398,m469
 It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him., I'll just set it right here., L439404, L439403,m469

" Hello, Charlie."," Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?", L438812, L438811,m469
" Yes, sir."," She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.", L438817, L438816,m469
" Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school."," Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.", L438820, L438819,m469
 We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.," What would that be, sir?", L438830, L438829,m469
" Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.", Of course., L438832, L438831,m469
 Did you study for the test?, Test?, L438689, L438688,m469
" Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today."," First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.", L438882, L438881,m469
" God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends."," Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.", L438884, L438883,m469
 Are you for real?," Touchy, touchy!", L438886, L438885,m469
 Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky., Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!, L439270, L439269,m469

" You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.", I wish she hadn't., L439305, L439304,m469

" Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants."," But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur.

 I was impressed with what you said in English class today.," Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.", L438923, L438922,m469
 You don't?," He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author ù fat, violent, drunk...", L438925, L438924,m469
 Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.," A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!", L438927, L438926,m469

" That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.", I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something., L439194, L439193,m469
 Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom., For everyone., L439197, L439196,m469

 But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time., That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer., L439208, L439207,m469
 You think so?, Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it., L439210, L439209,m469

 I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something., What?, L439221, L439220,m469
" Young lady, you're drunk!", Just a little. I've had a tough day., L438620, L438619,m469
 I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded., Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles., L438622, L438621,m469

" That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into."," Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands?

 The code's changed. We need Artoo!, Here's the terminal., L467081, L467080,m489
 I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew., He wasn't. I can feel it., L467180, L467179,m489
 Yes.," All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.", L467183, L467182,m489
 Han! Chewie?, Lando!, L466733, L466732,m489
" Lando, grab it!", Lower it!, L466736, L466735,m489
" Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando."," No, wait! I thought you were blind!", L466744, L466743,m489
 It's all right. Trust me. Don't move., All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!, L466746, L466745,m489
" Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando."," Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.", L466761, L466760,m489
" Well, look at you, a general, huh?"," Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.", L466820, L466819,m489
 Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.," All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?", L466840, L466839,m489
 Good luck.," You, too.", L466843, L466842,m489
" Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately."," Good, I hate long waits.", L466712, L466711,m489
" In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."," On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?", L466715, L466714,m489
 Here we go again.," All right, hang on.", L466852, L466851,m489
 What are you telling them?," Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.", L466936, L466935,m489
" Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"," I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.", L466938, L466937,m489
 Proper?!, It's against my programming to impersonate a deity., L466940, L466939,m489
 What did he say?," I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.", L466945, L466944,m489

" Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence."," You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.", L466610, L466609,m489
" I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.", Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them., L466612, L466611,m489
" I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.", The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation., L466614, L466613,m489
 But he asks the impossible. I need more men., Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives., L466616, L466615,m489
" That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.", We shall double our efforts., L466618, L466617,m489

 I'm going in., Here goes nothing., L467158, L467157,m489
 Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator., Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast., L467160, L467159,m489

 What's he saying?, He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge., L467017, L467016,m489
" Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!", Quiet., L467026, L467025,m489
 I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.," Oh, no.", L467028, L467027,m489
 Over there! Two more of them!," I see them. Wait, Leia!", L466882, L466881,m489
 Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?, Just a little bit. She died when I was very young., L466967, L466966,m489
 What do you remember?," Just...images, really. Feelings.", L466969, L466968,m489
 Tell me.," She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?", L466971, L466970,m489
 I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.," Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?", L466973, L466972,m489
 He's my father., Your father?, L466978, L466977,m489
" Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have."," You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.", L466981, L466980,m489
 Yes. It's you Leia., I know. Somehow...I've always known., L466983, L466982,m489
 Then you know why I have to face him.," No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.", L466985, L466984,m489
" No, you don't. You've always been strong."," But, why must you confront him?", L466987, L466986,m489
 The Emperor has been expecting you.," I know, father.", L467001, L467000,m489
 Come with me., Obi-Wan once thought as you do., L467007, L467006,m489
 You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master., I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me., L467009, L467008,m489
 If that is your destiny.," Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.", L467011, L467010,m489
 Obi-Wan has taught you well.," I will not fight you, father.", L467128, L467127,m489
" Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.", There is no conflict., L467131, L467130,m489
" You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now."," You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.", L467133, L467132,m489
" You cannot hide forever, Luke.", I will not fight you., L467143, L467142,m489
" Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.", Never-r-r!, L467146, L467145,m489
" Master Yoda, you can't die.", Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force., L466777, L466776,m489
 But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training., No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need., L466779, L466778,m489
" Yoda, I must know.", Your father he is., L466784, L466783,m489
" Told you, did he?", Yes., L466786, L466785,m489
" Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...", Unfortunate that I know the truth?, L466788, L466787,m489
" Well, I'm sorry."," Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.", L466790, L466789,m489
" Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?"," I am See-Threepio, human-cy...", L466647, L466646,m489
 Yes or no will do.," Oh. Well, yes.", L466649, L466648,m489
 How many languages do you speak?," I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...", L466651, L466650,m489
 Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him., Disintegrated?, L466653, L466652,m489
 We don't serve formula. Snookums.," You serve martinis, doncha?", L470972, L470971,m492
" Oh, a ladies man, huh?", My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie., L470981, L470980,m492
 No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.," Well, I'll be...", L470994, L470993,m492
" Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman."," I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?", L470975, L470974,m492
" Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.", You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold., L470977, L470976,m492
 My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...," C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?", L470983, L470982,m492
" And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.", So where is it then?, L470987, L470986,m492
 My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property., Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?, L470992, L470991,m492
" Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown."," Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?", L470856, L470855,m492
" Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'."," Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?", L470858, L470857,m492
" That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.", Shoulda guessed., L470860, L470859,m492
 He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.," Big on the musical comedy, huh?", L470862, L470861,m492
" What's this, Roger?", A tweeting bird?, L470782, L470781,m492
" Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.", I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times., L470786, L470785,m492
 Don't worry about me.  I can take it., I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe., L470788, L470787,m492
" So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!", Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money., L470830, L470829,m492
 This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow., You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket., L470832, L470831,m492
 Is this paper even good?, Check the scrawl., L470834, L470833,m492
" Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.", What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks., L470957, L470956,m492
 A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.," No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?", L470961, L470960,m492
 Do you think the rabbit did it?, I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink., L470969, L470968,m492
" Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.", Thanks for the vote of confidence., L470985, L470984,m492
" The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie."," Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?", L470990, L470989,m492
 So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?, He's a Toon... who cares?, L470998, L470997,m492
" Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?"," Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.", L471048, L471047,m492
 He's a riot.," Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?", L471054, L471053,m492
 So you decided to help him after all?, I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?, L471057, L471056,m492
" Can you get him out of it, Eddie?", If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this., L471066, L471065,m492
" So what's the scam, Eddie?"," Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.", L471073, L471072,m492
 Maybe they just took it out of his pocket., Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open., L471079, L471078,m492
" Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?"," Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.", L471083, L471082,m492
 What was <u>that</u>?, <u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife., L471198, L471197,m492
 The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?, Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife., L471200, L471199,m492
 I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.," Maroon, right?", L471202, L471201,m492
 Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again., What the hell would they want with a gag factory?, L471204, L471203,m492
 What's that comin' from the bar?, Sounds like singin'., L471207, L471206,m492
 I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you., I'll bet., L471314, L471313,m492
" Are you gonna call him, Eddie?"," What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?", L471316, L471315,m492
 Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.," That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?", L471318, L471317,m492
 He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.," Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?", L470924, L470923,m492
 Men?  They look more like weasles to me.," Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?", L470930, L470929,m492
 Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures., So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?, L470932, L470931,m492
" Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?", Ask her..., L471128, L471127,m492
" Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court."," He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.", L471132, L471131,m492
 They must've taken it off me., They?, L471137, L471136,m492
" Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown."," Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.", L471140, L471139,m492
 You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?, Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there., L471143, L471142,m492
 I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.," You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...", L471145, L471144,m492
" I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried."," Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.", L471253, L471252,m492
" Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector."," Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.", L471258, L471257,m492
" These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.", The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal., L471410, L471409,m492
 No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally., So you're Cloverleaf?, L471424, L471423,m492
" Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?", It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use., L471427, L471426,m492
 Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?, They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?, L471441, L471440,m492
" Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.", What the hell's a freeway?, L471444, L471443,m492
" A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another."," That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.", L471446, L471445,m492
" Holy shit, he's a Toon!", Surprised?, L471482, L471481,m492
 You?," That's right, me.", L471487, L471486,m492
 Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.," Earl... it's me, Valiant.", L471151, L471150,m492
" Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?", Toon cops worked me over., L471153, L471152,m492
" Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo."," What am I, Earl?", L471155, L471154,m492
 You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig., No..., L471157, L471156,m492
 Does it hurt?, Not much.  It's hard to talk., L471159, L471158,m492
 Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?," Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.", L471130, L471129,m492
" Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.", That's because I don't have a doorbell., L471168, L471167,m492
" Oh... well, I... I just had to see you."," Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.", L471170, L471169,m492
" Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?", Toons aren't given imperfections., L471173, L471172,m492
" No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.", You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything., L471175, L471174,m492
" Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work."," No, no, no... I love my husband.", L471177, L471176,m492
" Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home."," Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.", L471179, L471178,m492
" Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do."," I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.", L471181, L471180,m492
 So altruistic., It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?, L471185, L471184,m492
" Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder."," If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?", L471187, L471186,m492
 You shot Roger., That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon., L471377, L471376,m492
" Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong."," Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.", L471379, L471378,m492
" It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?", Why didn't you tell me?, L471383, L471382,m492
 I didn't know who I could trust.," We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.", L471385, L471384,m492
 Where is he?, He's right here in the..., L471387, L471386,m492
 How did you get onto Doom?, Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will., L471391, L471390,m492
 So where is it?," When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.", L471393, L471392,m492
" Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli..."," Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?", L471396, L471395,m492
 Hold on a second.," Eddie, come on.", L471406, L471405,m492
 Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit., That's what you woke me up for?, L470903, L470902,m492
 Now what?, Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile., L470906, L470905,m492
 They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day., What a gasser., L470909, L470908,m492
 Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?, No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since., L470940, L470939,m492

" When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.", Don't you have a Kiber crystal?, L542054, L542053,m529
" I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...", That's where my father was killed., L542056, L542055,m529
 Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful., Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?, L542058, L542057,m529
 They use the Bogan Force.," Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.", L542060, L542059,m529
 We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?," Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.", L542094, L542093,m529
 This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?, He's bluffing..., L542117, L542116,m529
" When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?", I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there., L542136, L542135,m529
 But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?, These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the..., L542138, L542137,m529
 What's wrong?  What's happening?," Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.", L542140, L542139,m529
 Are you all right?," Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.", L542142, L542141,m529
 Are you sure you don't need it?, I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on., L542155, L542154,m529
 What do I do?," All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.", L542157, L542156,m529
 What is it?, He can't find Organa Major., L542165, L542164,m529
 But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases., You mean we should go after her!..., L542191, L542190,m529
 I can't see!  How can I fight?, Try to feel it.  Use the Force..., L542212, L542211,m529
 I can't do it.  I'll get hit.," Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.", L542214, L542213,m529
" See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it."," I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.", L542216, L542215,m529
 What about the princess?, You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal., L542253, L542252,m529
 The Kiber Crystal., Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it., L542433, L542432,m529
" Of course, where you been kid?", You look great!  The uniform and everything!, L541905, L541904,m529
" That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!", But there was a lot of firing earlier..., L541910, L541909,m529
" I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...", But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?, L541930, L541929,m529
" The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.", At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position., L541932, L541931,m529
 You're Starkiller?," Yes, sir.", L542448, L542447,m529
 Have you been checked out?," Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.", L542450, L542449,m529
" Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on."," Yes, sir.", L542452, L542451,m529
" Blue Five, does that glare bother you?", I've got it blocked.  I'm all right., L542464, L542463,m529
" I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.", What's that?, L542491, L542490,m529
" Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?"," Yes, sir, but I can get him...", L542493, L542492,m529
 No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.," Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.", L542226, L542225,m529
 Should we alert the Sith Lords?, I'll make a report later., L542228, L542227,m529
" As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.", Send one squad up., L542230, L542229,m529
 We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it., Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear., L542233, L542232,m529
 Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.," Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!", L542362, L542361,m529
 Here come six more... grid two!, Was this trip really necessary?, L542386, L542385,m529
 There are only three or four left.," Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.", L542389, L542388,m529
 All the data banks in Artoo are still secure., Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through., L542394, L542393,m529
" When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.", What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?, L542396, L542395,m529
" The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo."," We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.", L542398, L542397,m529
 Where are you taking us now anyway?, The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca., L542400, L542399,m529
 I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless., Did it occur to you they might find us?, L542411, L542410,m529
 We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives., I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks., L542413, L542412,m529
" What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it."," I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?", L542421, L542420,m529
 Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand., That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first., L542092, L542091,m529

 Who's the pilot?, It's automatic., L542151, L542150,m529
" I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.", You don't believe in the Force?, L542159, L542158,m529
 I found it... It's just not there., What are you saying?, L542167, L542166,m529
 You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them..., Why?, L542179, L542178,m529
 Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.," All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.", L542188, L542187,m529
" No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!", Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try., L542195, L542194,m529
" Well, I practice a lot..."," You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?", L542208, L542207,m529
" Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.", Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around., L542268, L542267,m529
 This isn't going to work., Why didn't you say so before., L542281, L542280,m529
 Something has happened to them. Let's try this way..., Let's try this way!  Holy Maker., L542307, L542306,m529
 I think she's going to be all right., Not if this tunnel deadends., L542314, L542313,m529
 Is he afraid of the water?," No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.", L542320, L542319,m529
 Watch it!  Move back., Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away., L542323, L542322,m529
" It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!", Move out of the way!, L542328, L542327,m529
 Get to the ship!, Come back here... Where are you going?, L542349, L542348,m529
 I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right., They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there., L542407, L542406,m529
 You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...," I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.", L542429, L542428,m529

 The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed., Who is this?  What's your operating..., L542292, L542291,m529
" Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...", You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!, L541921, L541920,m529
 The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now., They'll find its weakness., L542145, L542144,m529
 No!..., It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste..., L542148, L542147,m529
 What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?, You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax., L542317, L542316,m529
 I am Luke Starkiller at your service., There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here., L542333, L542332,m529
 Are there medical facilities on Yavin?, He'll be well cared for., L542405, L542404,m529
 And you?, I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship., L542425, L542424,m529
 First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.," I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.", L541950, L541949,m529
 You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up..., But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!, L541952, L541951,m529
" I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.", You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here..., L541954, L541953,m529
 Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.," I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.", L541961, L541960,m529
 That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.," Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.", L541963, L541962,m529
 There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...," Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...", L541965, L541964,m529
 You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?," That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...", L541967, L541966,m529
 Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?," Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...", L541969, L541968,m529
" According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost..."," If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.", L541987, L541986,m529
" What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...", Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back., L542003, L542002,m529
" I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for."," No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...", L542005, L542004,m529
 I think we're going to need them. Blast it!," Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.", L542112, L542111,m529

 Are you safe?, For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now., L542345, L542344,m529
" Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...", See Threepio!  Do you copy?, L542352, L542351,m529
" Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot..."," Are you there, sir?  We're going...", L542368, L542367,m529
" Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.", I'd consider it an honor., L542438, L542437,m529
 Who is...'V'ger'...?, V'ger is that which programmed me., L544948, L544947,m531
 Where is Lt. Ilia?, That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise., L544952, L544951,m531
 Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?, V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator., L544955, L544954,m531
 Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?, To join with him., L544957, L544956,m531
 The Creator is that which created V'ger., Who is V'ger?, L544962, L544961,m531
 The examination is a normal function., You may proceede., L544968, L544967,m531
 <U>Why</U>...?!, The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet., L545120, L545119,m531
 <U>Why</U>?!, The Creator has not answered., L545122, L545121,m531
 The carbon-units are not responsible for that., You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner., L545124, L545123,m531
 Disclose the information., Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet., L545137, L545136,m531
" Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?", Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet., L545150, L545149,m531
 They have repressed the Creator., The information will not be disclosed., L545152, L545151,m531
 Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices., V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information., L545155, L545154,m531
 Our data is being prepared., <U>Answer</U>!, L545226, L545225,m531
 The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?, Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?, L545002, L545001,m531
 Yes., Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement., L545004, L545003,m531
 What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?, Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units., L545006, L545005,m531
 Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units., More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage., L545008, L545007,m531
 What does that mean?," When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.", L545010, L545009,m531
 Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns, That is logical. You may procede., L545012, L545011,m531
 Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?, The carbon units are of no consequence, L545035, L545034,m531
 You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator., That is how V'ger will survive., L545038, L545037,m531
 A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?, By the Creator., L545091, L545090,m531

 'To learn all that is learnable.'," It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.", L545108, L545107,m531
 And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?, It will... take me from <U>you</U>..., L545236, L545235,m531
 Departure angle on viewer., Departure angle., L544682, L544681,m531

 Yes., May I ask Why?, L544594, L544593,m531
" My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew..."," Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.", L544596, L544595,m531
" That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will."," No, Admiral. I don't think you are", L544599, L544598,m531
" We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible..."," None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.", L544617, L544616,m531
 Programming ready?," Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...", L544690, L544689,m531
 ... but I still recommend further simulation study., Mister Decker, L544692, L544691,m531
" Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?"," Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.", L544738, L544737,m531
" Then you acted properly, of course."," Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.", L544740, L544739,m531

 Soft and Wet. That's very interesting., My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?, L634844, L634843,m590
 I'm not sure., Think carefully?, L634848, L634847,m590
 What about the game?, It's finished. I won., L634850, L634849,m590

And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.", What was your idea Elijah?, L634519, L634518,m590
 At the church... You were following me weren't you?, Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you., L634526, L634525,m590
 What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?, You've misunderstood., L634528, L634527,m590

 Quick., The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?, L634593, L634592,m590

 Are you finished?, No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do., L634819, L634818,m590
 I am. I'm helping him with the sale., It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne., L634925, L634924,m590

 How so?," Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him.

They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.
