" Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset."," Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.", L64638, L64637,m28
" Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?"," Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!", L64658, L64657,m28
" You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!"," Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.", L64660, L64659,m28
" Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me."," I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?", L64798, L64797,m28
 I don't know.," Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.", L64800, L64799,m28
" Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time."," Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.", L64802, L64801,m28
" Where is my rascal, Lazlo?", I will let down the steps for your honor., L64831, L64830,m28
 Good gracious!  What is this?, You are going to drive to the frontier., L64833, L64832,m28
 It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.," I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.", L64835, L64834,m28
 Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand., Your honor must lower his voice., L64837, L64836,m28
 All Europe shall hear of this!, As you please., L64839, L64838,m28
 I have no luggage., The gentleman has nothing contraband., L64843, L64842,m28
 You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?," Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.", L64773, L64772,m28
 Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?," Yes, sir.", L64775, L64774,m28
 You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach., Herr Seebach was a very kind employer., L64777, L64776,m28
 For whom else have you worked?," No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.", L64779, L64778,m28
 Who else can give me information about you?, Only the agency of servants., L64781, L64780,m28
 And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred," I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.", L64788, L64787,m28
" The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?"," I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.", L64791, L64790,m28
 But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost., Have no fear.  It will come out well for me., L64814, L64813,m28
 I believe they will deport you., I have faced that problem before., L64816, L64815,m28
" But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?"," Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.", L64818, L64817,m28
" Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?"," Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.", L64845, L64844,m28
" When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?"," Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months", L64874, L64873,m28
 It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman., To risk one's life against such people is an imposition., L64909, L64908,m28
" I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.", Certain?, L64911, L64910,m28
" I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you"," Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?", L64894, L64893,m28
 Perfectly so," Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.", L64896, L64895,m28
 Then you yield to me., On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you., L64898, L64897,m28
 Very well, That is a trifle strong., L64900, L64899,m28
 No., Have you had one?, L64942, L64941,m28
 Never.," But, for a time... a passing fancy?", L64944, L64943,m28
 Not even that., How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?, L64946, L64945,m28
 Not one., Have you not a man whom you value?, L64948, L64947,m28
" That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.", What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?, L64950, L64949,m28
 Many worthy of attention, Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty., L64952, L64951,m28
" Your word ""empty"" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it."," It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.", L64954, L64953,m28
" But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune."," That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.", L64956, L64955,m28
" It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.", I agree, L64958, L64957,m28
" A man may need to do that, and find it amusing"," I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.", L64960, L64959,m28
 How so?," By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.", L64962, L64961,m28
 You want my heart?, It is my only object., L64964, L64963,m28
 To make me wretched in two weeks., To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands., L64966, L64965,m28
" The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me."," Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.", L64968, L64967,m28
 Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?," With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.", L64971, L64970,m28
 And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?, Then I will respectfully take leave of her., L64973, L64972,m28
 You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?, Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived., L64975, L64974,m28
" Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?"," I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.", L64977, L64976,m28
 Will we always leave it at this?," Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.", L64979, L64978,m28
" I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away."," Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.", L64981, L64980,m28
" Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.", My husband has convinced me of the contrary., L64983, L64982,m28
" Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it."," O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!", L64986, L64985,m28
" Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.", Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy., L64990, L64989,m28
" As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much."," We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  ""Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?""", L64992, L64991,m28
" My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:"," Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly", L65164, L65163,m28
" Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.", Old fool!, L65194, L65193,m28
" I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.", Agreed., L64445, L64444,m28
 I feel the ribbon., Then you must get it., L64450, L64449,m28
 Why are you shaking?, With pleasure at finding the ribbon., L64452, L64451,m28

" Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?", I don't care a fig for Captain Best, L64463, L64462,m28
" But you refused me, Dorothy."," Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.", L64465, L64464,m28
" If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is."," But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.", L64467, L64466,m28
" Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side."," I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.", L64469, L64468,m28
" What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?"," Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.", L64471, L64470,m28
" Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?"," Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.", L64494, L64493,m28
" I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?", As much as possible., L65071, L65070,m28
 As much as possible?," Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.", L65073, L65072,m28
" All the same, you must name an amount.", It is entirely up to you.  I want the best., L65075, L65074,m28

" Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?", Yes!, L65102, L65101,m28
 Does this assignment interest you?," Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.", L64771, L64770,m28
 Was he cheated?, In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly., L64805, L64804,m28
 A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible., The Prince left him only that choice., L64810, L64809,m28
 The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country., When is he to go?, L64821, L64820,m28

To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum."," You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.", L64629, L64628,m28
" I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance."," Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.", L65170, L65169,m28
" Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one."," I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.", L65172, L65171,m28
" There are a few other points we should discuss.

Are you serious?, L65174, L65173,m28
 May I be quite frank with you?," Yes, of course.", L65176, L65175,m28
" Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.", I see., L65178, L65177,m28

 I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.

" Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.", Would you have me spend my life all alone?, L64933, L64932,m28

" Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account."," Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?", L64994, L64993,m28

" Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.

" Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.

" I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?"," Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.

 A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council., He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland., L109897, L109896,m40
 Does anyone know his politics?," No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.", L110197, L110196,m40
 May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?, He was a modest man., L110402, L110401,m40
" If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?", Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!, L110407, L110406,m40
 The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.," That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.", L110409, L110408,m40
 He won't come., He will. I know he will., L110428, L110427,m40
 Longshanks promised!, You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king., L110438, L110437,m40
 Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!," I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.", L110023, L110022,m40
 What news of the north?," Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.", L110237, L110236,m40
" While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!", I have ordered conscriptions..., L110239, L110238,m40
 Wallace has sacked York!, Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie., L110241, L110240,m40
 The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!," So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.", L110291, L110290,m40
 Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France., The Scots will fight for us?, L110345, L110344,m40
 What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve., But if we have not caught Wallace --, L110347, L110346,m40
 His legend grows! It will be worse than before!, You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this., L110360, L110359,m40
 What is it?!, You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended., L109874, L109873,m40
 So I did! And what was so important about it?, Scotland. He intends --, L109876, L109875,m40

" Now, my flower, do you understand?"," Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.", L109886, L109885,m40
" Good day to you, M'Lords.", You mock us with a smile?, L110362, L110361,m40
 I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion., Wallace's followers., L110364, L110363,m40
 The little cow is insane --," Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.", L110370, L110369,m40
 Is it true? Wallace is captured?," Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.", L110434, L110433,m40
 When will his trial be?," Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.", L110436, L110435,m40
 I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace., You fancy him., L110467, L110466,m40
 Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.," Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.", L110471, L110470,m40

 Stephen ready?, Aye., L110317, L110316,m40
 Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.," We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.", L110376, L110375,m40
" Rest, William.", I rest., L110397, L110396,m40
 You know it's a trap., Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way., L110418, L110417,m40
 I don't want to be a martyr.," Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.", L110420, L110419,m40
" That's just a dream, William!", We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!, L110422, L110421,m40
" Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?"," My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.", L110424, L110423,m40

 We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.," Aye, we'll get 'em.", L109833, L109832,m40
 Test of manhood., You win., L109905, L109904,m40
" Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.", The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here., L109907, L109906,m40
 I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can., That depends on the man., L109911, L109910,m40
 Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?, I could crush you like a roach., L109913, L109912,m40
 You'll move, I will not., L109916, L109915,m40
 Good to see you again., I should'a remembered the eggs., L109927, L109926,m40

 I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine., He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won., L110350, L110349,m40
 So more men were slaughtered uselessly!, He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight., L110352, L110351,m40
" We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.", In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break., L110354, L110353,m40

 You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?," ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.", L110282, L110281,m40

 No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war., This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool., L110287, L110286,m40
" Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.", My greatness is better demonstrated with this., L110289, L110288,m40
 I have faced him. Have you?, Let her speak., L110367, L110366,m40
 Treason. Against whom?," Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?", L110441, L110440,m40

 I want... to marry you!, I... accept your proposal!, L109960, L109959,m40

 When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north., How do you know this?, L110115, L110114,m40
 Last night I slept with a member of the War Council., He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed., L110117, L110116,m40
 This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?," A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.", L110120, L110119,m40
" Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife.

 I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight., I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are., L110257, L110256,m40
" Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?"," York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.", L110259, L110258,m40

 Peace is made is such ways., SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!, L110272, L110271,m40
 I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman., She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant., L110274, L110273,m40
 A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it., It does me good to see you., L110380, L110379,m40
 Why did you?, Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met., L110386, L110385,m40
 You have... you have a husband.," I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.", L110390, L110389,m40
" You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England.

 You will die! It will be awful!, Every man dies. Not every man really lives., L110462, L110461,m40

" Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk."," And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?", L110216, L110215,m40
" No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.", We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why., L110218, L110217,m40
 I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.," Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country.

If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.", L110220, L110219,m40
 War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you., I am trying., L110306, L110305,m40
 Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it., I must... consult with my father., L110308, L110307,m40

 So you decided to go to America.," Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.", L119125, L119124,m42
" Yes, I'll bet."," He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.", L119127, L119126,m42

 You want my advice?," Oh, yes, please.", L119139, L119138,m42

 The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much., You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do., L118972, L118971,m42
 Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are., Practically no one., L118974, L118973,m42
" If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.", So could I. And I'm a poor businessman., L118976, L118975,m42
" I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.", And the carrying charges?, L118978, L118977,m42
 Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters., I'll tell him when he comes in., L118980, L118979,m42
" Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are."," Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.", L118982, L118981,m42
 That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.," Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.", L118984, L118983,m42
" Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?"," It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.", L119379, L119378,m42
" Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man."," Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.", L119381, L119380,m42
 Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.," And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.", L119383, L119382,m42
 Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.," Well, so long.", L119385, L119384,m42
" Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.", I shall remember to pay it... to myself., L119387, L119386,m42
" You see, my dear, the word has gone around."," As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.", L119013, L119012,m42
 I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --," -- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.", L119018, L119017,m42
" We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much."," Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?", L119031, L119030,m42
" I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?"," Yes, something.", L119034, L119033,m42
 Do you know where they are?," Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.", L119037, L119036,m42
 Rick?," He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.", L119039, L119038,m42
" It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.", Good day., L119043, L119042,m42
 And Mademoiselle?, You needn't be concerned about me., L118929, L118928,m42
" Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.", This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca., L119220, L119219,m42
" That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.", Occupied France?, L119222, L119221,m42
 Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me., What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past., L119224, L119223,m42
 There are only two other alternatives for him., What are they?, L119226, L119225,m42
 It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here., And the other alternative?, L119228, L119227,m42
" -- It was ""La Belle Aurore."""," How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.", L118781, L118780,m42
 Not an easy day to forget., No., L118783, L118782,m42
" I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."," Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.", L118785, L118784,m42
 Say goodnight to Sam for me., I will., L118797, L118796,m42
" There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam.", He hasn't played it in a long time., L118799, L118798,m42
 Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?," We said ""no questions.""", L118845, L118844,m42
 A franc for your thoughts., In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth., L118848, L118847,m42
 I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me., And I was wondering., L118850, L118849,m42
 Yes?, Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along., L118852, L118851,m42
 Why there is no other man in my life?, Uh huh., L118854, L118853,m42

" Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here."," I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.", L118860, L118859,m42
 My German's a little rusty., It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow., L118865, L118864,m42
" With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love."," Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?", L118867, L118866,m42
 Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?, Looking for a job., L118869, L118868,m42
" Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?"," Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.", L118871, L118870,m42
 Strange. I know so very little about you.," I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.", L118876, L118875,m42
" But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris."," No, no, no, no. We must leave.", L118878, L118877,m42
" Yes, of course, we --", -- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty., L118880, L118879,m42
" No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?"," All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?", L118882, L118881,m42
 That's too far ahead to plan.," Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?", L118884, L118883,m42
" Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?"," I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...", L118887, L118886,m42
 Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.," No. No, Rick. Not tonight.", L118894, L118893,m42
 Please., Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places., L118897, L118896,m42
" I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know."," It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. ""Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop.""", L118899, L118898,m42
" Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel."," Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?", L118901, L118900,m42
 I didn't count the days.," Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.", L118903, L118902,m42
" Can I tell you a story, Rick?", Has it got a wow finish?, L118905, L118904,m42
 I don't know the finish yet.," Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.", L118907, L118906,m42
" It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love."," Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, ""Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid,"" it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?", L118909, L118908,m42
 I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night., It doesn't matter., L118993, L118992,m42
 Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?, Yes., L119000, L118999,m42

" Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know."," Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.", L119004, L119003,m42
" Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?", You can believe that if you want to., L119006, L119005,m42
" All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there."," No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.", L119009, L119008,m42
 How did you get in?, The stairs from the street., L119271, L119270,m42
" I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?"," Richard, I had to see you.", L119273, L119272,m42
" You use ""Richard"" again? We're back in Paris.", Please., L119275, L119274,m42

 I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.," I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.", L119279, L119278,m42
 Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?," It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.", L119281, L119280,m42

" No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.", What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it., L119289, L119288,m42
 -- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me., I don't have to. I've got them right here., L119292, L119291,m42

I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.", L119301, L119300,m42
" Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me.

" I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us."," All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.", L119312, L119311,m42
" Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?"," No, not yet.", L119403, L119402,m42
" But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?", Everything is quite all right., L119405, L119404,m42
" But why my name, Richard?", Because you're getting on that plane., L119447, L119446,m42
 I don't understand. What about you?, I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away., L119449, L119448,m42

" I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.", No., L119457, L119456,m42

 Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?," Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.", L119194, L119193,m42

 I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.," My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.", L119198, L119197,m42
 There must be some reason why you won't let me have them., There is. I suggest that you ask your wife., L119200, L119199,m42
 I beg your pardon?," I said, ask your wife.", L119202, L119201,m42
" Well, this might come in handy.", Thank you., L119332, L119331,m42
" Had a close one, eh?"," Yes, rather.", L119334, L119333,m42
 Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?," We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.", L119336, L119335,m42
" You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil."," Yes, I get the point.", L119339, L119338,m42
 I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed., You seem to know all about my destiny., L119341, L119340,m42
" I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.", You love her that much?, L119343, L119342,m42
" Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you."," Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.", L119410, L119409,m42
" I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.", Keep it. You'll need it in America., L119412, L119411,m42
 But we made a deal.," Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?", L119414, L119413,m42
 No. It's all arranged.," Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.", L119416, L119415,m42
 Everything in order?, All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave., L119465, L119464,m42
" Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything."," I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.", L119467, L119466,m42
 Yes.," But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?", L119469, L119468,m42
 I understand., Here it is., L119473, L119472,m42
" Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?", Yes., L118676, L118675,m42
" I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.", Yes. What is it you want?, L118678, L118677,m42
 Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.," Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?", L118680, L118679,m42
" No, Captain, please."," No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.", L118687, L118686,m42
 Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word., Very well., L118706, L118705,m42
 My bill.," No. Two champagne cocktails, please.", L118733, L118732,m42
" Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!", This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you., L118772, L118771,m42
" Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle."," Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.", L118787, L118786,m42
 Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office., We'll be there., L118806, L118805,m42
 I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?, I slept very well., L118918, L118917,m42
 That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca., May we proceed with the business?, L118920, L118919,m42
 With pleasure. Won't you sit down?, Thank you., L118922, L118921,m42
" I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur."," Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.", L118927, L118926,m42
 And the honor of having served the Third Reich., I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime., L118937, L118936,m42
" Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --", -- Thank you., L118944, L118943,m42
" By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.", Yes., L118946, L118945,m42
 I believe you have a message for him?," Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?", L118948, L118947,m42
 I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape., Are you quite finished with us?, L118952, L118951,m42
" I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.", You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!, L118699, L118698,m42
" I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.", I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil., L118701, L118700,m42
 This is hardly the time or the place.," Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.", L118703, L118702,m42
" Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca."," Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.", L118924, L118923,m42
 Is that all you wish to tell us?," Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.", L118931, L118930,m42
 And that is?," You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.", L118933, L118932,m42
 Even in Berlin.," Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.", L118935, L118934,m42
 You will give us the names?," If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more ""persuasive methods"" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.", L118939, L118938,m42
" And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast."," Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.", L118941, L118940,m42
 For the time being., Good day., L118954, L118953,m42
 Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.," Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.", L118385, L118384,m42
" You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major."," Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.", L118390, L118389,m42
" What else, my dear Major?"," By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?", L118392, L118391,m42
" Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's."," I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.", L118397, L118396,m42
" Good evening, gentlemen."," Good evening, Captain.", L118585, L118584,m42
" Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.", Champagne and a tin of caviar., L118588, L118587,m42
" May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.", Thank you., L118590, L118589,m42
" Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers."," I expected no less, Captain.", L118594, L118593,m42
" Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich."," How do you do, Mr. Rick?", L118613, L118612,m42
" You repeat ""Third Reich"" as though you expected there to be others."," Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.", L118619, L118618,m42
" Ho, diplomatist!", How about New York?, L118633, L118632,m42
" Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.", You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you., L118638, L118637,m42
" Of course, one must admit he has great courage.", I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again., L118649, L118648,m42
" You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.", Perhaps., L118653, L118652,m42
 Mademoiselle., Mademoiselle., L118708, L118707,m42
 I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.," If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.", L118911, L118910,m42
 You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.," But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they ""blundered"" into Berlin in 1918.", L118913, L118912,m42
" As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.", It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here., L118915, L118914,m42
" You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe."," My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.", L119078, L119077,m42
" Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?"," I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.", L119080, L119079,m42
" We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader."," A leader, like Laszlo?", L119084, L119083,m42
" Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.", I see what you mean., L119086, L119085,m42
" You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.", But everybody's having such a good time., L119209, L119208,m42
" Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.", But I have no excuse to close it., L119211, L119210,m42
 What is the meaning of that phone call?, Victor Laszlo is on that plane., L119486, L119485,m42
 Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?, Ask Monsieur Rick., L119488, L119487,m42
" Hello, Louis."," How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.", L118505, L118504,m42
" You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?"," When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.", L118507, L118506,m42
 The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?, Why? What's in Lisbon?, L118510, L118509,m42
 It was a combination of all three., And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?, L118514, L118513,m42
 My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters., Waters? What waters? We're in the desert., L118516, L118515,m42
 I was misinformed., Huh!, L118518, L118517,m42
" Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe."," What, again?", L118525, L118524,m42
" If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.", I stick my neck out for nobody., L118528, L118527,m42
" You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.", Our entertainment is enough., L118531, L118530,m42
 I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency., Perhaps not., L118534, L118533,m42
" How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.", Yeah? Have a brandy?, L118540, L118539,m42
" Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.", I thought it was because we let you win at roulette., L118542, L118541,m42
 That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa., Yeah? What's his name?, L118544, L118543,m42
 Victor Laszlo., Victor Laszlo?, L118546, L118545,m42
" Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed."," Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.", L118548, L118547,m42
" It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.", It'll be interesting to see how he manages., L118550, L118549,m42
 Manages what?, His escape., L118552, L118551,m42
" Oh, but I just told you. --", -- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe., L118554, L118553,m42
 This is the end of the chase., Twenty thousand francs says it isn't., L118556, L118555,m42
 Is that a serious offer?, I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back., L118558, L118557,m42
 Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official., Okay., L118560, L118559,m42
" Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.", Why two?, L118562, L118561,m42
 He is traveling with a lady., He'll take one., L118564, L118563,m42
" I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.", Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are., L118566, L118565,m42
 It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.," Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?", L118568, L118567,m42
" Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.", And got well paid for it on both occasions., L118571, L118570,m42
 The winning side would have paid you much better.," Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.", L118573, L118572,m42
 I have my orders.," Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.", L118575, L118574,m42
" Yeah, you were saying?", Excuse me., L118579, L118578,m42
" Oh, how do you do?", And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich., L118615, L118614,m42
 That makes Rick a citizen of the world., I was born in New York City if that'll help you any., L118625, L118624,m42
" Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --"," -- Hello, Ilsa.", L118759, L118758,m42
" Oh, no, Rick never --", -- Thanks. I will., L118770, L118769,m42
" Oh, it's my party."," Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.", L118793, L118792,m42
" Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.", That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open., L119055, L119054,m42
" Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?"," Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?", L119057, L119056,m42
 Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.," Well, it looks like you're a little late.", L119059, L119058,m42
 So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.," Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.", L119062, L119061,m42
" As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.", Yeah? Why?, L119180, L119179,m42
 Why do you interfere with my little romances?, Put it down as a gesture to love., L119182, L119181,m42
 How can you close me up? On what grounds?," I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!", L119215, L119214,m42
" But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now."," Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --", L119353, L119352,m42
 -- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?," Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.", L119355, L119354,m42
" Well, they're all excellent reasons."," Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.", L119357, L119356,m42
" You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.", Huh?, L119359, L119358,m42
 And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate., What friend?, L119361, L119360,m42
 Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America., You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?, L119363, L119362,m42
" Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?", It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful., L119367, L119366,m42
" I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance."," There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.", L119370, L119369,m42
 I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?, I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen., L119373, L119372,m42
" Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I."," Oh, thanks.", L119375, L119374,m42
 You're late.," I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.", L119390, L119389,m42
 I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.," Oh, he won't be followed here.", L119392, L119391,m42
" You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky."," Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.", L119394, L119393,m42
 I have the letters right here.," Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?", L119397, L119396,m42
 Sam's piano., Serves me right for not being musical., L119399, L119398,m42
" -- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.", Have you taken leave of your senses?, L119423, L119422,m42
 I have. Sit down over there., Put that gun down., L119425, L119424,m42
" I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?", I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later., L119430, L119429,m42
 Call off your watch-dogs you said.," Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.", L119432, L119431,m42
" If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official."," You think of everything, don't you?", L119444, L119443,m42
 Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist., Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about., L119480, L119479,m42
" What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying."," Anyway, thanks for helping me out.", L119482, L119481,m42
" I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course."," As soon as the plane goes, Louis.", L119484, L119483,m42
" Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot."," Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.", L119501, L119500,m42
 It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage., My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs., L119504, L119503,m42
 And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses., Our expenses?, L119506, L119505,m42
 Uh huh.," Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.", L119508, L119507,m42
 Where were you last night?," That's so long ago, I don't remember.", L118484, L118483,m42
 Will I see you tonight?, I never make plans that far ahead., L118486, L118485,m42
 Give me another.," Sacha, she's had enough.", L118488, L118487,m42
" Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --"," -- Sacha, call a cab.", L118492, L118491,m42
" Come on, we're going to get your coat.", Take your hands off me!, L118495, L118494,m42
" Make it official, if you like.", What is your nationality?, L118622, L118621,m42
 I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation., There seems to be no secret about that., L118627, L118626,m42
 Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?, It's not particularly my beloved Paris., L118629, L118628,m42
" Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.", Aha. Who do you think will win the war?, L118635, L118634,m42

 Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?, Yes sir., L180010, L180009,m53
" What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point."," Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.", L180012, L180011,m53

 Good! How is the patient?," He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.", L180119, L180118,m53
 A few words? I thought he was imbecile?," Well sir, perhaps I should explain...", L180121, L180120,m53

" ...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.", He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?, L180177, L180176,m53
" Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly."," Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.", L180179, L180178,m53

 Treves. Well done.," Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.", L180227, L180226,m53
 Can you imagine what his life has been like?," Yes, I think I can.", L180234, L180233,m53
" You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.", I could easily arrange..., L180237, L180236,m53
" No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?"," Well, yes.", L180239, L180238,m53
" Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.", Do you think they'll go along with us?, L180241, L180240,m53
 Don't we?," No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.", L180255, L180254,m53
 Has the response picked up?," Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.", L180315, L180314,m53
 But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen., Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post., L180317, L180316,m53
 Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...," Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.", L180516, L180515,m53

Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - ""a patsy"".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, ""O.H. Lee"" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?", L327831, L327830,m104

Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep?

" If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?"," Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.", L327782, L327781,m104
" Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.", Makes sense - he's a spokesman., L327790, L327789,m104
 Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?," None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.", L327798, L327797,m104

" Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.", And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?, L327803, L327802,m104
 None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.," Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.", L327805, L327804,m104
" The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.", Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet., L327807, L327806,m104

" All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him."," I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying ""We both know who's responsible.""  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?", L327821, L327820,m104
" ...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name ""Oswald"" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name ""Oswald"" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity."," Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.

For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.

 Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?," Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.

" Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?", Right., L371742, L371741,m131
 And there it is.," I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.", L371745, L371744,m131
" Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.", We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself., L371755, L371754,m131
 I think I heard about that., Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets., L371757, L371756,m131
 Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...," I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.", L371759, L371758,m131

 A-negative. I've cross-matched it., I though you said we didn't have a drop., L371684, L371683,m131
 Radar!, All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end., L371837, L371836,m131
 What for?, We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out., L371891, L371890,m131

 That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home., I like an olive., L371188, L371187,m131

" But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf."," So let's haul ass, Sergeant.", L371495, L371494,m131
 Look., Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive., L371498, L371497,m131
" Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that."," Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?", L371512, L371511,m131

 Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time., Radar!, L371648, L371647,m131
" For you, Trapper."," Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?", L371655, L371654,m131

 I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in., I don't get it., L371677, L371676,m131
 It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery., What do we do?, L371679, L371678,m131
 We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side., Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?, L371681, L371680,m131
 It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?, They're coming., L371709, L371708,m131
 But he's got five times the man-power to draw on., We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones., L371763, L371762,m131
 He only lasted one season., On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him., L371768, L371767,m131
 So what makes you think he'll play for us?, We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college., L371772, L371771,m131
" Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.", He can move in here with us., L371774, L371773,m131
 But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good., Not necessarily., L371802, L371801,m131
" Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?"," Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?", L371373, L371372,m131
" Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine."," I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.", L371375, L371374,m131
 All of them?, That's right. We work well together., L371377, L371376,m131
 Major Burns is far from satisfied.," That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.", L371379, L371378,m131
" On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army."," And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.", L371381, L371380,m131
 I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.', It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but..., L371383, L371382,m131
 That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.," Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.", L371385, L371384,m131
 I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.," Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.", L371387, L371386,m131
" Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want."," No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.", L371711, L371710,m131
" Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?"," Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...", L371789, L371788,m131
 The bastards outconned us., I think we could still have a chance., L371796, L371795,m131
" If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?"," No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game.

 What's the matter?," We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.", L371831, L371830,m131
 See you., It's possible, L371883, L371882,m131
" Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.", There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you..., L371066, L371065,m131
" Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.", No trouble at all.  Hawkeye., L371068, L371067,m131
 How did you get called that?, 'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read., L371070, L371069,m131
" You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.", It isn't always this rough?, L371072, L371071,m131
" Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.", They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together..., L371074, L371073,m131
 Our minds?," For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...", L371076, L371075,m131
 You're an attractive man., You have a certain modest charm yourself., L371078, L371077,m131
 But I'm married., Something else we have in common., L371080, L371079,m131
 Very happily married., Same here., L371082, L371081,m131
" And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?"," It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.", L371084, L371083,m131
 I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men., Ayuh., L371086, L371085,m131
" You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.", Of course not., L371088, L371087,m131
 It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.," Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?", L371090, L371089,m131
 Even if I weren't., Maria..., L371165, L371164,m131
 I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow., You're leaving tomorrow?, L371308, L371307,m131
 In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way., That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby., L371310, L371309,m131
" Dear, sweet Hawkeye.", Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband., L371312, L371311,m131
 You're on his side all of the sudden?, A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck., L371314, L371313,m131
 How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?, It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions., L371316, L371315,m131
" Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.", I didn't mean with me., L371319, L371318,m131
 You're asking for somebody else?, It happens to be a matter of life and death., L371321, L371320,m131
 A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?," Precisely, Maria.

" He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.", You think he won't., L371325, L371324,m131
 What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.," I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...", L371327, L371326,m131
" It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you."," I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...", L371329, L371328,m131

" I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.", I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?, L371468, L371467,m131
" At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.", Why would he do that?, L371470, L371469,m131
 Two-man job. How much blood has he had?, Second pint., L371059, L371058,m131
 It was really nice of you to take me along., I didn't have much choice., L371461, L371460,m131

 You don't go after the local scrunch?," I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.", L371536, L371535,m131
 What do you do in the joint besides pimp?, That's about the only thing I don't do û that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer., L371538, L371537,m131
 Why can't you look at him?," I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.", L371577, L371576,m131

" If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?"," Tell me the whole story, Walt.", L371229, L371228,m131
 There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed., There's only one worth noticing., L371231, L371230,m131

 The other thing is..., ...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs., L607408, L607407,m218

" You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said ""don't, don't"" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, ""Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?""  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?", I think so., L29667, L29666,m239
 Are you sure?, No., L29669, L29668,m239
" When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?", It may never come out., L29671, L29670,m239
 Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.," Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.", L29673, L29672,m239
 And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?, I couldn't say., L29675, L29674,m239
 But it's possible., It is., L29677, L29676,m239
 You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.," I would, if you really ever wanted to know.", L29679, L29678,m239
" We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?", Nobody ever had too much., L29683, L29682,m239
 --you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--, --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--, L29380, L29379,m239
 --correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--," --this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?", L29385, L29384,m239
 Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--," --well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--", L29387, L29386,m239
" --absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--"," --well, what if your boys get it wrong--", L29389, L29388,m239
 Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?," You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?", L29045, L29044,m239
" As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.", Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?, L29047, L29046,m239
" ...go on, go on..."," That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.", L29106, L29105,m239
" OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.", I did all right on McCord., L29114, L29113,m239
" Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?", The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?, L29116, L29115,m239
" Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  ""...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it.""", You can't believe that., L29118, L29117,m239
 What'd you get on W.House?, Lotsa hints--, L29121, L29120,m239
 Who's Charles Colson?," I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, ""I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?""", L29135, L29134,m239
" Who's Colson, Harry?"," The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.", L29137, L29136,m239
" The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel."," Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?", L29139, L29138,m239
" Whaddya got, whaddya got?"," Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.", L29153, L29152,m239
 So?, I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty., L29159, L29158,m239
 --who you got?--," --well, Sloan--", L29621, L29620,m239
 Anything?, Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--, L29109, L29108,m239

 --has any of them got an ax?--," --political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--", L29615, L29614,m239
" --listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--", --go over your sources again--, L29891, L29890,m239
" --listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--"," --Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--", L29895, L29894,m239
 More denunciations?, One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes., L29932, L29931,m239
 What else have you got?," According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  ""I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee.""", L29155, L29154,m239
 Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?, Absolutely., L29157, L29156,m239
 --no--, --can we use their names?--, L29617, L29616,m239
 What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?," Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.", L29661, L29660,m239
 You think she wants us to ease up on the story?," I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?", L29663, L29662,m239
 --which Young?," Larry Young, a California lawyer--", L29828, L29827,m239
 --and he says Chapin hired Segretti--," --well and good, but when will he say it on the record.", L29832, L29831,m239
 Mr. Sloan?," My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.", L29566, L29565,m239
" I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.", You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--, L29570, L29569,m239
" Does ""they"" mean the White House?", As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that., L29581, L29580,m239
" The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?", No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand., L29583, L29582,m239
" And as treasurer, you could release those funds?", When so ordered., L29585, L29584,m239
 Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that., Haldeman.  Right?, L29591, L29590,m239
" I can't say anything, I'm sorry. "," One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?", L29597, L29596,m239
 Go on.," Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.", L29602, L29601,m239

 --and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.," No, none of those.", L29859, L29858,m239

 Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning., Yeah., L48049, L48048,m247
 Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days., Dreadful., L48051, L48050,m247
" Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.", Well --, L48053, L48052,m247
 We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here., We need all our fuel., L48055, L48054,m247

 Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --, I like all of them --, L48064, L48063,m247
" Good -- like I said, take your pick.", I said I like all of them., L48066, L48065,m247
 We need all our fuel anyway., Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --, L48069, L48068,m247
 What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me., My men --, L48072, L48071,m247
 What !, That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --, L48074, L48073,m247

 You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together., Get out --, L48083, L48082,m247
 Two whole drums --, We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --, L48087, L48086,m247
 I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --, I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --, L48089, L48088,m247

 I was an FO for the 25th., Tracks ?, L47643, L47642,m247

 Thirty -- sometimes fifty.," You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...", L47649, L47648,m247

 Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.," Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't.

 How?," They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.", L48007, L48006,m247
 I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --, No shit., L48096, L48095,m247
 Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there., I don't believe you --, L48098, L48097,m247

 They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.," The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.", L98958, L98957,m277
" Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?", The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa., L99031, L99030,m277
 It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war, Dien Bien Phu?, L98962, L98961,m277
" In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.", And here?, L98965, L98964,m277
" Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names", I understand. What's your question?, L99033, L99032,m277
" The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ..."," Let's try to be precise then. The word ""torture"" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?", L99035, L99034,m277
" The law is often inconvenient, colonel ..."," And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer ""yes,"" then you must accept all the necessary consequences.", L99037, L99036,m277
" Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...", Sid Ahmed., L98983, L98982,m277
 Second name., Sail., L98985, L98984,m277

 Third group. What's your assignment?, Uh ... responsible for the sixth section., L98993, L98992,m277
 You afraid of these ...?," Don't move, Hacene.", L98753, L98752,m277
" Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?", It's true., L98755, L98754,m277
 What's happened to you?, The NLF has condemned you to death., L98757, L98756,m277
 How much are they paying you?, They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice, L98761, L98760,m277
 What ... What must I decide?," You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!", L98763, L98762,m277
 With an unloaded pistol?, I'll explain., L98718, L98717,m277
" Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...", Sure. By shooting at me., L98720, L98719,m277
" Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...", I don't even know your name yet ..., L98722, L98721,m277
 But I haven't shot him., You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried., L98725, L98724,m277
 What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing., C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back., L98727, L98726,m277
 I don't do that kind of thing., Then don't complain., L98729, L98728,m277
 You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.," Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?", L98731, L98730,m277
 And how many are we?, Not enough., L98733, L98732,m277
 Why? Isn't he sleeping here?," No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.", L98904, L98903,m277
" It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--"," Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.", L99011, L99010,m277
 Of course. As soon as possible.," No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...", L99013, L99012,m277
 Go away!, Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ..., L98690, L98689,m277
 Can you read?, Sure ..., L98697, L98696,m277
 Read it., Here?, L98699, L98698,m277
 Where's Kader?, With the others. They are trying to stop the people., L98828, L98827,m277
" Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...", Let's try ..., L98914, L98913,m277
 It's good nobody is following us ..., It's a question of habit ..., L98916, L98915,m277
" What do you think of the strike, Ali?", I think it'll be a success ..., L98920, L98919,m277
 It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.," No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more", L98923, L98922,m277
 No ..., But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike., L98925, L98924,m277
" No, and neither were my men.", Why?, L98927, L98926,m277
" Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right."," That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...", L98929, L98928,m277
" To show them to the UN, right?"," Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.", L98931, L98930,m277
 Good evening ... Can we pass?, It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible., L98807, L98806,m277
 But it's not even midnight yet!, It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight., L98809, L98808,m277
" Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.", I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question., L98811, L98810,m277
 Where were we?," Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...", L98771, L98770,m277
" Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow."," Good evening, sir.", L98790, L98789,m277

" All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere."," Good evening, sir.", L98794, L98793,m277
" Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...", A name?, L98890, L98889,m277
" And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over."," Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.", L99122, L99121,m277
" Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ..."," Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.", L99127, L99126,m277
 Why?," For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.", L99075, L99074,m277
 You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ..., Of course I am., L99077, L99076,m277
 That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.," No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.", L99079, L99078,m277
 What is she saying?, She says that Ali is still in the Casbah., L99081, L99080,m277
 Who is speaking?, Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu., L99046, L99045,m277
" Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.", How can I give you this statement?, L99050, L99049,m277

 This time the Militia will kill us., They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance., L289286, L289285,m390

 They do not have your connections.," Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think ""Paul Rusesabagina is a fool.

 What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done., No.  You're trying to beat me., L438228, L438227,m468

" Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?", The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service., L437737, L437736,m468
 What about easier to hit in an air raid?," Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?", L437739, L437738,m468

" Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk.

He took me back to his house, and I never left.", You were more like brothers., L437849, L437848,m468

 How's everything?," We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.", L437900, L437899,m468
 That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile., I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?, L437902, L437901,m468

 Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium., I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball., L438273, L438272,m468
" I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.

" Don't get smart with me, son."," Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.

" You have something to say, Yamamoto?"," The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours.

 Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?," How about I go right, sir?", L483203, L483202,m502
 How about...?, How about you shut up and take your position?, L483206, L483205,m502
 HOLD YOUR FIRE!, Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field., L483231, L483230,m502
 Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder., About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal., L483238, L483237,m502
 SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.," More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...", L483245, L483244,m502
 Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine., Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before., L483247, L483246,m502
 You alright?, Let's just find someplace., L483266, L483265,m502
" What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?", Vecchio., L483269, L483268,m502
" Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?", Yeah., L483271, L483270,m502
 You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?, Bits and pieces., L483273, L483272,m502
" She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.", And what about your own hand?, L483275, L483274,m502
" No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?", It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men., L483277, L483276,m502
" Oh, yeah?"," Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.", L483279, L483278,m502
 And how do you bluff yourself?," Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.", L483281, L483280,m502
" Except this time, the mission IS a man."," That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.", L483283, L483282,m502

 What do you think?," Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.", L483411, L483410,m502
 What are we going to do?, We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else., L483413, L483412,m502

" Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?"," Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.", L482782, L482781,m502
" So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen."," Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?", L482789, L482788,m502
" Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?"," Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.", L482791, L482790,m502
" There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen."," Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.", L482793, L482792,m502
" I don't think so, Captain."," Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.", L482797, L482796,m502
" Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading."," Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...", L482854, L482853,m502
" Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best."," No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?", L482856, L482855,m502

" Captain, can I ask you a question?"," Sure, Reiben.", L482889, L482888,m502
" Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me."," Yeah, how so?", L482907, L482906,m502
" I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead."," There's to be a bright side, look for it.", L482909, L482908,m502
" Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.", There's always a bright side., L482911, L482910,m502
" I'm listening, sir."," Well, I, for one, like cheese.", L482913, L482912,m502
" General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain."," Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.", L482961, L482960,m502
" Jesus Christ, he's a natural!"," Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?", L483029, L483028,m502
" Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?"," Sure, what do you want to know?", L483088, L483087,m502
" Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?", Ours is not to reason why., L483090, L483089,m502
 Huh?," Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.", L483092, L483091,m502
" I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing."," Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.", L483094, L483093,m502
" Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers."," You have orders, too.", L483101, L483100,m502
" Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?"," I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?", L483117, L483116,m502
" In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance."," Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.", L483120, L483119,m502
 Any further thoughts on the subject?," Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.", L483124, L483123,m502
" Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.", We can't leave it here., L483189, L483188,m502
 Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it..., Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices., L483255, L483254,m502
 Up.  We're moving out.," I thought you said we had an hour, sir?", L483299, L483298,m502
" I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.", Why's that?, L483312, L483311,m502
" Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive."," Except for the last part, that one's not bad.", L483314, L483313,m502
" B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.", I don't like that one., L483316, L483315,m502
" Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.", But we accomplish the mission., L483318, L483317,m502
" Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division."," Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?", L483320, L483319,m502
" No, sir.", That's a mystery to me., L483322, L483321,m502

" You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules."," Have it your way, Captain.", L483346, L483345,m502
" Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir."," You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?", L483391, L483390,m502

" Your mother, too.", Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck., L568014, L568013,m548
 Steve., There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is., L568021, L568020,m548
 Think you can get me any of that?," Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.", L568024, L568023,m548
 Mine's the Eleventh.," But... he only wrote nine, Major.", L568026, L568025,m548
" I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?", No. Ours was damaged., L568028, L568027,m548
 What's in those files?," The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. FurtwΣngler?", L568030, L568029,m548
 I'm sorry.," Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.", L568045, L568044,m548

 Of course.," Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.", L568385, L568384,m548
" I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all."," What is this, Emmi?", L568473, L568472,m548
 I can't do this. It's not right., What's not right?, L568475, L568474,m548
 I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.," Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.", L568477, L568476,m548
" But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested."," If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?", L568479, L568478,m548
 I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?, I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria., L568176, L568175,m548
" What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm FurtwΣngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.", That is correct., L568178, L568177,m548
 Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?," I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.", L568180, L568179,m548
" What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President."," I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.", L568182, L568181,m548
" Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?"," Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.", L568184, L568183,m548
 Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?," I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.", L568188, L568187,m548
" That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration"," That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.", L568190, L568189,m548
 How come?," Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?", L568192, L568191,m548
 I made no deal!, I don't buy that., L568197, L568196,m548
 I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?," I don't remember in detail, there were so many.", L568200, L568199,m548
 Did you call someone you knew?," I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.", L568202, L568201,m548
 Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them., May I ask a question?, L568205, L568204,m548
 Sure., When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?, L568207, L568206,m548
 Your guess is as good as mine., I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends..., L568209, L568208,m548
" Tough, tough!"," Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?", L568211, L568210,m548
" I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?", It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me., L568213, L568212,m548
 Why were they going to arrest you?, I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies., L568215, L568214,m548
" So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?"," During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. FurtwΣngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.", L568218, L568217,m548
 You sure knew a lot of people in high places.," It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.", L568220, L568219,m548
" You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean.

You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.", L568222, L568221,m548
" I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt..."," They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?", L568225, L568224,m548
 Steve Arnold...," I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.", L568232, L568231,m548
" I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. FurtwΣngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?"," Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.", L568239, L568238,m548
" Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?"," Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone", L568241, L568240,m548
 Who?, I wasn't told. I just knew it., L568243, L568242,m548
 How?, I was warned., L568245, L568244,m548
 Who warned you?, Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels., L568247, L568246,m548
 What did Goering say?, He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word., L568249, L568248,m548
 It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again., Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you., L568387, L568386,m548
" If it's too hot, open your tie.", I wish to say something., L568394, L568393,m548
" When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.", And what was that?, L568397, L568396,m548
" Maintain liberty, humanity and justice."," Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?", L568399, L568398,m548
" I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost."," And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?", L568401, L568400,m548
 What telegram?," 'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'", L568403, L568402,m548
 I have no idea what you're talking about.," The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.", L568405, L568404,m548
 I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.," Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.", L568407, L568406,m548
 You won't find it because no such telegram exists.," Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me.

And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.", L568412, L568411,m548
 Then you are wrong.," Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?", L568414, L568413,m548
" We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor."," You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?", L568416, L568415,m548

" Yes, I know who he is."," Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?", L568426, L568425,m548
 That's an outrageous lie!," You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?", L568428, L568427,m548
 Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me., And what did he say?, L568430, L568429,m548

And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck.

But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard.

 Please... may I have it back..., You have nothing to regret..., L598790, L598789,m565
 I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!, Silence her!  Take her away...!, L598792, L598791,m565
" I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?", And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed..., L598803, L598802,m565
" I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!", It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul., L598805, L598804,m565
 I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession..., I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry..., L598807, L598806,m565
" Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?", He's feeling wonderful., L598385, L598384,m565
 Thanks be to God., And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?, L598387, L598386,m565
" Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...", Buying her?, L598389, L598388,m565
" This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...", I understand.  How much?, L598391, L598390,m565
" 20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed."," Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?", L598399, L598398,m565
" Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...", You think?, L597763, L597762,m565
 Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours., W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?, L597765, L597764,m565
 Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?, You really think she's been sent... by God?, L597767, L597766,m565
 You will??," For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.", L597878, L597877,m565
 It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...," I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...", L598306, L598305,m565
" Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.", But... her army's so small now..., L598315, L598314,m565
" There's no need to be afraid, sire.", I'm... I'm not the king..., L597809, L597808,m565
 What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it., You did well..., L597829, L597828,m565
 ... and what... what did he say?," He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.", L597833, L597832,m565
 I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans..., Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest., L597840, L597839,m565
" Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...", ... You look wonderful..., L598235, L598234,m565
 Get them out of here!," Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!", L598269, L598268,m565
 Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?," Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...", L598271, L598270,m565
 So how would you put it?," Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, ""to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace""...", L598273, L598272,m565
 Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!, Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper..., L598275, L598274,m565
 She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!, She says she'll be here tomorrow...!, L597749, L597748,m565
" You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.", What difference does it make where she comes from?, L597751, L597750,m565
" Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure."," I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?", L597756, L597755,m565
" Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!"," My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?", L597774, L597773,m565
 Supposing she's an assassin?," Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?", L597776, L597775,m565
" Your majesty, I really think you..."," My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...", L597818, L597817,m565
" ... as always, majesty...", ... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone., L597820, L597819,m565
 My captains have sworn their support., No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?, L597875, L597874,m565
 He's probably right -- let's call a delay...," There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...", L598207, L598206,m565
 I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?, Noooo!, L598311, L598310,m565
" When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?"," If there was, I didn't see it...", L598546, L598545,m565
 Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?, Go and ask him yourself., L598548, L598547,m565
 You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?, His face., L598581, L598580,m565
 Does he have hair?, Yes., L598583, L598582,m565
 Is it long and hanging down?," I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.", L598585, L598584,m565
 But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?, Go on to the next question., L598587, L598586,m565
" 5,000 gold crowns.", That's not a lot., L598393, L598392,m565
 It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.," I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.", L598395, L598394,m565
" May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?"," 20,000 gold crowns.", L598397, L598396,m565
" 8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.", I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow., L598401, L598400,m565
 Were you sent by Lord Dunois?, Yes... they were., L597929, L597928,m565
 Good.  Where are the English?, Everywhere.  Where is the food?, L597931, L597930,m565
 It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot..., I know..., L597933, L597932,m565
 Good.  Can you bring me to him?, He's on the other side of the river., L597935, L597934,m565
" Wait, wait...", For what?, L597945, L597944,m565
" Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?"," Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!", L597947, L597946,m565
" Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything."," You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!", L597949, L597948,m565
 So... what is the message?," We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.", L597971, L597970,m565
" Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?", God., L597973, L597972,m565
" You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God."," Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...", L597978, L597977,m565
" ""Be patient, be patient""... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!"," Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.", L597982, L597981,m565
" Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl."," Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?", L597984, L597983,m565
 Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!, Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?, L598027, L598026,m565
" Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...", The wind will be against us..., L598039, L598038,m565
 What's going on?, We're taking back the Tourelles!, L598098, L598097,m565
" Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front..."," I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!", L598103, L598102,m565
 Stand by with the battering-rams..., We need another ten minutes..., L598126, L598125,m565
 Well...?  Shall we go?, Not yet., L598190, L598189,m565
 My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!," Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?", L597913, L597912,m565
 The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!," Yes, it's a miracle.", L597915, L597914,m565
 And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...," Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...", L597917, L597916,m565
 But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?," As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.", L597919, L597918,m565
" Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?", That'll put fire in my soldiers!, L597850, L597849,m565
" God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.", Damn right!, L597975, L597974,m565
 I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!, Me too..., L597989, L597988,m565
 There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!, Yes.  We can pray., L598054, L598053,m565
 This is no good!, No good?  This is a disaster!, L598249, L598248,m565
 And... what does Jeanne think?," I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.", L597969, L597968,m565
" We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.", But the bridge has been pulled down!, L598033, L598032,m565
 Clear?, Perfectly., L598120, L598119,m565
 You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?, No... not like this..., L598158, L598157,m565
" Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?", I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine..., L598174, L598173,m565
 Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?, Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess..., L598182, L598181,m565
 Jeanne... The men are exhausted!," I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!", L598251, L598250,m565
 Jeanne... we're not enough..., So... bring up the reinforcements!, L598253, L598252,m565
 Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!," Jeanne, look behind you.", L598256, L598255,m565
 Do you know how to count?, Of course I do?  Bring them up!, L598259, L598258,m565
 Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers., But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?, L598261, L598260,m565
" He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...", But my voices... they promised me..., L598263, L598262,m565
 Who told you to wear men's clothes?, The clothes are not important..., L598591, L598590,m565
" You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...", It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers..., L598593, L598592,m565
 So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?, I... submit to Our Lord., L598595, L598594,m565
 But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?, It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?, L598597, L598596,m565
" Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?", I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands., L598627, L598626,m565
 Did your voice tell you to jump?, No..., L598629, L598628,m565
" So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?", No...!, L598631, L598630,m565
" How can you deny it when you just said ""I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English""...?", That's now what I meant..., L598633, L598632,m565
 Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!," I know, but that's not the way things happened...", L598635, L598634,m565
 You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?," Yes, but...", L598637, L598636,m565
 And you didn't jump of your free will?, No!, L598639, L598638,m565
 Stop it!  What are you doing?, Nothing... just taking his teeth., L598161, L598160,m565
 But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!, Why not?  He has good teeth..., L598163, L598162,m565
" Besides, what about these...?", That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!, L598167, L598166,m565
 Yeah..., Here -- take this instead., L598178, L598177,m565
 So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??," Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!", L597937, L597936,m565
" La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!", Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?, L597939, L597938,m565
" Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois."," Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...", L597943, L597942,m565
 Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!, They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that., L597952, L597951,m565
 What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?," God knows, but it was a bad idea!", L598023, L598022,m565
" I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...", Don't swear..., L598057, L598056,m565
 Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!, I'd sooner die than use magic!, L598066, L598065,m565
 Prepare these as battering-rams!, What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!, L598110, L598109,m565
 We... won?!," Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!", L598152, L598151,m565
 You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...," ... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!", L598155, L598154,m565
 Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!, Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous..., L598171, L598170,m565
 Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth..., A few teeth... that's the price of his life?, L598176, L598175,m565
" Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up..."," I said, kneel!", L598186, L598185,m565
 You don't believe me anymore?," We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...", L598266, L598265,m565
" When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?", Yes... a half-steed... white., L598603, L598602,m565
 Who gave you that horse?, My king., L598605, L598604,m565
 How many did he give you?, Five steeds and a few hackneys..., L598607, L598606,m565
 As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?, No., L598609, L598608,m565
 What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?," Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...", L598611, L598610,m565
" Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?"," And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?", L598613, L598612,m565
 Jeanne... what are you doing?, Playing..., L598142, L598141,m565
 What have you done to me?, I -- I -- I..., L598146, L598145,m565
 Who... who are you...?, I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one..., L598354, L598353,m565
 Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?, No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling..., L598359, L598358,m565
 I don't know... I thought..., YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?, L598362, L598361,m565
 I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead..., WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?, L598364, L598363,m565
 I... don't know... what do you want from me?, Nothing.  I'm here to set you free..., L598366, L598365,m565
 What are you doing out here?, I might ask you the same question., L598415, L598414,m565
 I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore..., And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?, L598417, L598416,m565
 Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!," You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...", L598419, L598418,m565
 I... I never lied!," If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...", L598421, L598420,m565
" I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me..."," How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  ""What are you doing to me, Jeanne?""", L598423, L598422,m565
" That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?"," No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!", L598426, L598425,m565
" Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!", I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!, L598428, L598427,m565
" Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?", I don't understand.  What do you want from me?, L598430, L598429,m565
 Why were you yelling like that?!, What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here..., L598508, L598507,m565
 Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?, Yes!, L598510, L598509,m565
 My... visions..., They're going to come and visit you in here?, L598513, L598512,m565
 Yes... that's what I pray for...!, I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you., L598515, L598514,m565
" No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!", Why not?, L598517, L598516,m565
 They won't come anyway.," What do you mean, they won't come?", L598520, L598519,m565
 Why would they?," Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...", L598522, L598521,m565
 God asked you to do something?, Yes... lots of things!, L598524, L598523,m565

 What signs?, Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!, L598528, L598527,m565
 No.  That was a sword in a field., But... it didn't just get there by itself., L598530, L598529,m565
" I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!", Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory..., L598669, L598668,m565

" Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's ""the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..."" he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?

 I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?, Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?, L598689, L598688,m565
" Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?", I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?, L598691, L598690,m565

" I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...", Why did she have to die?, L597724, L597723,m565
 Only God knows the answer to that., I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!, L597726, L597725,m565
" I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.", Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!, L597728, L597727,m565

 Where are you hiding?, In the attic., L599375, L599374,m566
 What's all that gunfire?, The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks., L599382, L599381,m566
 What's happening?, We're getting out., L599385, L599384,m566
 Are the Russians here?, Not yet., L599387, L599386,m566
 I don't know how to thank you., Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe., L599389, L599388,m566
 What about you?, I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?, L599391, L599390,m566

 Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here., I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school., L609317, L609316,m570

Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.", L609457, L609456,m570
 Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.," Oh, God.", L609479, L609478,m570

 They shouldn't have been here.," We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!", L609566, L609565,m570
 This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.," Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.", L609568, L609567,m570
 What are you doing., Low on gas.  Got to refill., L609588, L609587,m570
 You two fighting's not going to get us anything., Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either., L609599, L609598,m570

 Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere., Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--, L609779, L609778,m570
 Where'd they go?, I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--, L609785, L609784,m570

 You ready?," All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--", L609874, L609873,m570
 It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light., What about the gold?, L609894, L609893,m570

 You got no reason to do that!," I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?", L609907, L609906,m570
 You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around., Then get up and do something about it., L609910, L609909,m570
 Get off him.," He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.", L609916, L609915,m570
 What happened?, I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us., L609919, L609918,m570
 Stop it!, I told you, L609924, L609923,m570

 Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold., How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it., L609931, L609930,m570
" I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.", Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out., L609938, L609937,m570
" We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...", You said he was a deserter., L609941, L609940,m570

" No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.", Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand., L610002, L610001,m570

 I'm the one's got the big stick., Suppose I don't go for that?, L610006, L610005,m570
" Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.", What about Jaeger?, L610008, L610007,m570
" In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.", We thought--, L610152, L610151,m570
" Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good."," Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.", L610158, L610157,m570
 Wes--," Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?", L610160, L610159,m570

" You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man", That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert., L610168, L610167,m570
 They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.," You don't know John Epps very well, do you?", L610177, L610176,m570
 Just keep quiet., I have to answer him., L610182, L610181,m570
 So you can give us away?," If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.", L610184, L610183,m570
 Give it to me!," If I give it to you, will you let us go?", L610198, L610197,m570

 You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting., Blow me., L609297, L609296,m570
 Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control., Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me., L609327, L609326,m570

In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.
